# python-spam-classification-model

This model was created as part of the coursework of my Machine Learning and Data Science I course.

Read the Technical Report PDF for the project's requirements and goal.

Insrtructions:

1) Place the test data set in the same working directory of the IDE program that will be used so the pandas function can read it.

2) In order to use the test data set, on Line 32 in the "main.py" file change the ‘train.csv’ to ‘your_data_set’s name.csv’
