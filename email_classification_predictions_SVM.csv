liberal defnitionsdepends on how much over spending vs how much and what type over regulation  the biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible it also has the ability to single out particular people while over spending spreads the damage more evenly  rent control would be an example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending tons of money on public housing  as for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose both i find no fault in that definition whatsoever  the opinion that either we are spending too much or we have too much regulation is pretty much anathema to liberal politics  finally those who argue that there are private replacements for much government regulation are not saying that a state of nature no private replacements no government regulation is better than government regulation itself  and in my experience people who label themselves green which does not include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly is a watermelon      original message  from forkadminxentcom mailtoforkadminxentcom on behalf of geege  schuman    funny i read it as green  red as in accounting as in fiscally  irresponsible  which do you think is the worse indictment   overregulation  or overspending  there are many dickheads who buy into the  neoconservative medias foxs definiton of liberal as one who seeks  to  impose both   ,ham,ham

hansons sept 11 message in the national review httpwwwnationalreviewcomhansonhanson091102asp   september 11 2002 800 am the wages of september 11 there is no going back    september 11 changed our world those who deny such a watershed event take a superficially shortterm view and seem to think all is as before simply because the sun still rises and sets  this is a colossal misjudgment the collapse of the towers the crashing into the pentagon and the murder of 3000 americans β€” all seen live in real time by millions the world over β€” tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds which if and when they heal will leave ugly scars for decades the killers dealt in icons β€” the choice of 911 as the date of death targeting the manifest symbols of global capitalism and american military power and centering their destruction on the largest jewish city in the world yes they got their symbols in spades but they have no idea that their killing has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine  islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant but static morally repugnant β€” and the worst plague upon the arab world since the crusades by lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth the vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and bombs but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 911 they prove only ghoulish not fearsome  the more the world knows of al qaeda and bin laden the more it has found them both vile and yet banal β€” and so is confident and eager to eradicate them and all they stand for it is one thing to kill innocents quite another to take on the armed might of an aroused united states easily dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of afghanistan may make good theater and bring about braggadocio dealing with grim american and british commandos who have come 7000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and an occasional cheap infomercial on the run and the ultimate consequence of the attacks of september 11 will not merely be the destruction of al qaeda but also the complete repudiation of the taliban the iranian mullocracy the plague of the pakistani madrassas and any other wouldbe fundamentalist paradise on earth  foreign relations will not be the same in our generation our coalition with europe we learn was not a partnership but more mere alphabetic nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of euroamerican globetrotters β€” a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the cold war the truth is that europe out of noble purposes for a decade has insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an antidemocratic eu a 80000person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often dubious international accords this sad realization september 11 brutally exposed and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the moment completely lost its moral bearings indeed as the months progressed the problems inherent in the european way became all too apparent pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness abstract moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility and constant american anklebiting even as europe lives in a makebelieve shire while we keep back the forces of mordor from its picturesque borders with only a few brave frodos and bilbos tagging along nothing has proved more sobering to americans than the skepticism of these blinkered european hobbits after september 11  america learned that moderate arab countries are as dangerous as hostile islamic nations after september 11 being a saudi egyptian or kuwaiti means nothing special to an american β€” at least not proof of being any more friendly or hostile than having libyan syrian or lebanese citizenship indeed our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of their anticommunism oil and arms purchases β€” like nato β€” belongs to a pre911 age of soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies now we learn that broadcasting statesponsored hatred of israel and the united states is just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles β€” and as likely to come from friends as enemies worstcase scenarios like iran and afghanistan offer more longterm hope than stable regimes like the saudis governments that hate us have populations that like us β€” and vice versa the saudi royal family whom 5000 american troops protect and the mubarak autocracy which has snagged billions of american dollars are as afraid of democratic reformers as they are islamic fundamentalists and with good reason islamic governments in iran and under the taliban were as hated by the masses as arab secular reformers in exile in the west are praised and championed  the post911 domestic calculus is just as confusing generals and the military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of iraq chicken hawks and worse yet such traditional vietnamera invective i think rings hollow after september 11 and sounds more like mcclellans shrillness against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery ended than resonant of pattons audacity in charging after murderous nazis more americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of vietnam nearly 30 years ago indeed most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of vietnam are now in or nearing retirement and thank god there is no generation of americans in the present military β€” other than a few thousand brave veterans of the gulf mogadishu and panama β€” who have been in sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties because american soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security is lax in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in lower manhattan fly regularly on a jumbo jet or handle mail at the pentagon or cia than be at sea on a sub or destroyer  real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than rejecting force inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad as our women children aged and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at home it seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into harms way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect thousands in highrises  politics have been turned upside down in the old days cynical conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes repellent realpolitik in the age of russian expansionism they were loathe to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist trojan horse whose belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians thus they were so often at loggerheads with naγ―ve and idealist leftists  no longer the end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive soviet communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy champions of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise open economics loot their treasuries and keep out the russians instead even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in the middle east than are dour and skeptical leftists the latter if multiculturalists often believe that democracy is a valueneutral western construct not necessarily a universal good if pacifists they claim nonintervention not justice as their first priority the right not the left now is the greater proponent of global freedom liberation and idealism β€” with obvious domestic ramifications for any republican president astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support  all this and more are the wages of the disaster of september 11 and the subsequent terrible year β€” and yet it is likely that for good or evil we will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead      ,ham,ham

performance issues      well theres this wonderful piece of code in mhseqexpand            hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that dont exist       foreach m rseq            if file exists mhprofilepathfolderm                exmhdebug mhprofilepathfolderm not found               set ix lsearch seq m               set seq lreplace seq ix ix            else                 real hack  at least im upfront about my hacks                 break                        which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch   of messages that dont exist   im not sure why it is important that the   first message in the sequence returned exists but not necessarily any   of the others but im sure glad it is as mhseqexpand gets called lots   and i dont know if i could cope if it were checking every file in the   sequences it is looking at all the time  that was my thinking  my recollection about the first message being valid is that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting for example or you are selecting a message to display    it may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current   folder though that would then need to be verified against changes to the   directory   does tcl have a directory read function   i assume so  glob nocomplain mhprofilepathfolder  will return an unsorted list of the directorys contents but the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun exmh already maintains incore lists of messages in sequences which is already pretty tricky    mhsequence also goes and rereads the files mhsequences and the   context file but im not sure how frequently that one is called  in some places i maintain caches of files by checking their modify time but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to check their date stamp you could just read them again  also now that we checkpoint message state on every message view that file will change every time  in the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about the folder   brent welch software architect panasas inc pioneering the worlds most scalable and agile storage network wwwpanasascom

nothing less than monsters who will stoop to any level to get their way  yeah sure dave whatever you need to believe  the truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and improving rss in general  each with their own brand of attitude to be sure but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move forward  how is that being monstrous  is dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the publics perception of them  if you havent already contact them and ask them how they feel about this foolishness    91802 100738 am  discuss    dave deflects what he cant take the time to understand   its really quite pitiful  when normal people dont understand something they usually try learning about it  they read up ask questions and seek the help of those that understand it  this before shooting their mouths off and looking like fools  what dave does is just the opposite  posts a link to something he doesnt understand gets a bunch of email from people who do understand it derides the idea as being too much trouble and blogs it expects others to do research for him abuses anyone who tries to help him pontificates incorrectly about only part of the issue realizes hes been a fool but refuses to correct himself plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy tries making the educated people look like fools sends private emails to them trying to scare them off exposes any private email they write out of context deflects and runs off to some new topic repeats from 1 his continued diatribes about rss10 and its use of rdf reveal this to be true  dave doesnt get the idea of the semantic web  hed rather have you follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth trying  one reader wrote to us with a good analogy  its like that movie the poseidon adventure  daves like the purser ranting and raving that the passengers should follow him and march toward the bow  i dont know about you but id rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room the ships fucking sinking and i dont want to be following the idiot  daves idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around  youre supposed to just shut up and take it  after all why would good ol uncle dave want to hurt you  its all about love right  to hell with asking you if you want to get shafted  and if you dare complain he savages you  then he tries to make everyone think youre the one causing all the trouble  weve news for you dave were wise to your tactics and were talking amongst ourselves about it  were routing around you damaging behavoir thats where were coming from  if you have an example of how youve tried to help dave please drop us an email about it  well keep it strictly confidential of course  send it along to zaphodegroupscom    91202 101311 am  discuss     trying to talk with dave is like trying to wrestle a pig   the trouble is you get dirty and the pig seems to like it  another developer tries talking to dave and discovers its fundamentally impossible  his basic response was just that rdf was a joke and the semantic web developers are doing a terrible job  in the span of less than five minutes dave makes such an ass of himself that people at other tables start whispering that guy is an idiot  the zaphodim however are veteran pig wrestlers  if youve got a similar tale from the mud pit be sure to drop us a line at zaphodegroupscom    91102 21758 pm  discuss 1 response     aha some backing down by the whining one   it would appear the dictator release strategy that daves been trying on his crappy little set of rss hacks is failing to gain support  im going to push back the caveatremoving on the 20 spec by 24 hours still have work to do on the sample file i want to look into the rfc for timedate specs and get started on the radio implementation of 20 i have to prepare for seybold tomorrow and i want to a little memorial for 911 a busy few days for a guy still recovering also it would be great if people who make content tools could review the 20 spec and see if there are any dealstoppers  hell yeah there are deal stoppers like nobody wants it nor will they use it  the poor radio customers  the poor salon blog users  theyre going to be dragged unwillingly into producing xml content that nobody will use  so with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch dave is going to turn all their content into totally unsupported garbage  ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start getting rejected  of course at the same time dave tries to play the sympathy card  what utter fucking nonsense  this past weekend the blogosphere excoriates him for his blame america bullshit  then the rss community tells him to get stuffed with his dictator release of rss  now hes trying to pretend we should be nice to him because hes still recovering  uh dave if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking fights  well still kick your ass regardless  thats what years of your abusing people has gotten you dave  no sympathy anymore none whatsoever    91102 15610 pm  discuss     dave is scary on 911  posted on scripting news on 9102002   note during the day tomorrow there will be no updates to scripting news ill be in sf at seybold leading a discussion on web services for publishing with people from amazon apple google and jake savin of userland i may be able to update my radio weblog but only if theres something really important to report so best wishes for a happy and safe 911 what kind of asshole wishes people a happy 911 obviously someone who doesnt have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy    91102 75606 am  discuss     yeow and we though we were harsh   wow apparently daves sticking his neck out quite far these days  craig schamp practically keelhauls him with this one  he wraps it up with  the man seems to show over and over that hes nothing more than a whining buffoon  give that man an honorary zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring  related links over at photodude richard bennett andrea harris reid stott jeff jarvis ipse dixit and the fat guy    9902 122945 pm  discuss     rss 20 code name hitler   if dave tries to steamroll rss 20 through without formal community consensus here now we call it the hitler release of 20  no objections  no he means no objections i choose to hear  dave is simply not listening  people are objecting all over      9602 90002 am  discuss     referral log funnies   every now and then we check the referral logs to see whats pointing back to us  we sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search    9502 121507 pm  discuss     luserland attempts to trademark rss   dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any bigco that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally bankrupt scripting news is full of examples  so we found it surprising as did many others when luserland software tried to patent the term rss back in 2000 heres the patent application  httptarrusptogovservlettarrregserserialentry78025336  this was apparently just between the start of the rss 10 development efforts and the publication of the specification winer knew about the rss 10 stuff  indeed he complained about it bitterly at the time  could dave be any more transparent  since when has dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others to do a good quote from before he filed the patent application  tim oreilly says patents are ok hes just against stupid patents in the spirit of touch of grey tim man patents are lockin of the worst kind theres no way to route around them   9402 60651 am  discuss     whens a permalink not a permalink   when dave writes an item then removes it the permalink links to nothing at that point so apparently the perma part in permalink is permanent for everyone except dave too bad his little attempt at a definition fails to mention this    9202 61603 pm  discuss

was something special  alb moylan 49 is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet alb  and marry  thai women he lives in england now with 28yearold wan alb who is expecting their first child  alb critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women alb in developing countries offering dreams of a new life in the west that alb often turn sour but moylan says he has no regrets about coming to thailand alb in search of a wife  alb i got to thailand at 2 pm and by 4 pm id met wan he said i knew i alb found her attractive i could tell straight away that she was very caring  alb moylan spent a week in thailand and after returning to england kept in alb touch with wan by phone and mail six months later she came to england and alb the couple married  alb mr marriage  alb lawrence lynch 49 runs thai professional introduction services the agency alb moylan used to meet his wife lynch who calls himself mr marriage alb started the company after also marrying a thai woman through an introduction alb agency  alb since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages  alb in the last five years weve done about 400 he said to the best of my alb knowledge they have all been successful  alb male clients pay 2213 for the service although men from countries that alb require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount alb clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of thai women alb looking for a husband if they like what they see they come to bangkok  alb clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in lynchs alb office  encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and alb language problems  alb we find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies alb lynch said but once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax  alb after the first meeting couples can decide to go on dates to get to know alb each other better within two weeks of arrival lynch says almost every alb client has found a potential wife  alb at the end of a fortnight its very very rare for a guy to go back and alb think he hasnt made his mind up he said in most cases marriage follows alb usually within the next year  alb roongthip kamchat managing director of thai no 1 connections a alb bangkokbased agency says she has introduced about 1000 couples and less alb than 10 percent have broken up  alb roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just alb arrived in bangkok looking for a wife  alb sometimes they are very nervous she said and sometimes they are very alb impatient and say give me a lady i want to get married now i say calm alb down ok well talk  alb but if men are really in a hurry roongthip says she can find them a wife alb and get them married within a week lynch says clients he has found wives alb for include a blind man a man with one leg and a man with posttraumatic alb stress disorder  alb why  alb similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries critics alb say they thrive on the neediness of lonely western men who are unable to alb form relationships in their own country and on the desperation of alb impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the west  alb but moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy there is alb no reason to object if you talk about people who are needy i think alb everybody wants someone to love them and wants someone to love so yes i alb need wan he said  alb thai women are dissatisfied with life in thailand i think theres no alb secret there they are looking for a better life i dont have a problem alb with that in return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to alb their future husband  alb lynch says men are dissatisfied with western women too and that is why they alb choose to use his agency  alb his brochure promises an alternative to the kind of defeminized alb oversized selfcentered mercenaryminded lady available on the british alb singles scene and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are alb not gods gift to women  alb roongthip said many western men found it difficult to meet women in their alb own countries  and found thai women attractive  alb they dont know how to meet women even if they go to pubs or discotheques alb or restaurants or department stores how can they ask people to marry them alb impossible she said  alb many thai girls are slim have long hair black eyes small nose they are alb good at taking care and joking and laughing not strict different from alb ladies from other countries  alb although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap alb the agencies say this is not a problem they say language problems are also alb not a major obstacle  alb thai ladies are not ageist and they have no qualms whatsoever about having alb a husband who is significantly older lynch said when i met my wife she alb couldnt speak a word of english we muddled along with a phonetic alb dictionary the ladies are very keen to learn english and they pick it up alb very quickly  alb many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move alb to the west  alb we have kitchens we have study classes roongthip said we teach them alb how to eat and when to make tea  alb pitfalls  alb but not all dreams come true bee is a 26yearold thai woman who went to alb switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency now she is alb back in bangkok sad and angry  alb he had no friends and i was so lonely she said i tried to make him alb happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean he never alb spoke to me  alb bee came back to bangkok earlier this year i thought i would be happy alb there she said but it was the worst time of my life  alb lynch says that while some agencies are badly run he makes checks to ensure alb unsuitable candidates are weeded out  alb we are ethical and professional he said we will not take on all alb comers  alb moylan says that despite possible pitfalls his own marriage is proof the alb arrangement can work wans sister has just

speaking on april 13  and vince kaminski has tentatively agreed to speak on  april 20   i am going to be out of town on april 27  so that leaves either next  thursday  april 6  or may 4  would either of those times work for you  i  m  not thinking of any preparation  but more of an informal discussion of the   philosophical issues  related to real options work   jim       original message       from  jim dyer  sent  thursday  march 30  2000 1  24 pm  to   jclevenger  optionii  bus  utexas  edu   subject  re  real options course feedback  josh   some very thoughtful observations  as you know  i had invited one  finance professor to our class on arundel  but he was out of town  i do  plan to invite sheridan titman to discuss the issue of using the option  models in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded   i do think it is important to face that issue  which is actually covered at  a theoretical level in our last couple of readings   the issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for further  discussion  as you suggest  so far  we  ve been looking at cases where  volatility is  given   the problem of finding an  objective  measure of  volatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correct  risk adjusted discount rate  which is not surprising since the concepts are  almost two sides of the same plate  one approach  of course  is to do some  modeling using traditional decision analysis tools  including subjective  probabilities  but the finance people who write options articles don  t like  to think about such ideas   i  ll try to address these issues in more detail as the semester  continues  i think it was important to surface some of these points early   and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a  naive sort of way   thanks for the feedback and comments   jim       original message       from  jclevenger  optionii  bus  utexas  edu  sent  thursday  march 30  2000 8  42 am  to  jim  dyer  bus  utexas  edu  cc  josh  clevenger  reliantenergy  com  subject  real options course feedback  after overcoming the initial  i hope  overload of materials and tools  presented  thus far in the semester  it appears to me that you are achieving the  objective  of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety  of  problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded  financial elements   as a constructive feedback  you have been forthright with us in marking off  areas of this subject which are still controversial  i also realize that  rightly so  real  world application of this type of analysis without a robust  understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions  that  result in a  house of cards  effect  my opinion at this point is that two  issues are of potentially  make  or  brake  importance if i am to persuade my  superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of  projects  whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by  financial  instruments  these issues are easy to guess   1  discounting and risk free rates  i do not sense that anyone in the  class  has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time  value  questions in the absence of liquidity  is there someone within the finance  department that can present a firmer position on this question   2  volatility  i found winston  s examples on this metric succinct  i would  recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this  subject  my criticism again relates to messy problems  i anticipate  arguments  against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility  measures   if i were a conservative financial manager  i would argue that      two  a  implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of  equity  options is a shotgun approach   the projects being valued are of a tranche  which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the  weighted average measured by the equities utilized  oil  gas and electricty  are  good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of  the  value chain  smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata   but  what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a  vertically integrated company      two  b  based on the following skepticism  if a real option value is  being  proposed for a new business venture  some new unexploited opportunity    there is  some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new  ventures and the high risk of failure  this skepticism is likely to be less  acute in high  tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded  before us daily by nasdq touts  it is a much harder sell to  mature   industries   of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around  opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas  sectors  as regulation is removed  a large proportion of the risk is embedded in  ongoing  changes of public policy on an international basis  as an intentionally  screwed  up example  can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses  volatility for u  s  companies investing in seed projects in mexico based on  speculation of the

re about usb hard drives and errorson 20100411005025 stan hoeppner wrote   paul e condon put forth on 4102010 1141 pm       so the fact that my wd drives dont play well with smart doesnt     make them special and i should not spend much if any time looking    for a usb solution what other options are there for external hd      youre got 3 usb hard drives already and youre throwing them out and   looking for another solution just because they dont do smart  if   neither usb nor firewire do smart you choices are very limited    well the sad story is that i dont really want to do smart i was  experiencing disk errors on the drives which caused something in the  kernel to throw a fit when this happened the only recovery i could  find was to reboot this is slow and not really a way to learn how to  fix the problem so i ask for advice on this list i work down the  list of suggestions not having much success and arrive at  smartctl but now we know that that doesnt work for reasons that i  might have known if i had read the whole of wikipedia and had total  recall  but i hadnt and i dont    since my last post i have succeeded in doing a successful error  free backup to each of the disks one notable fact about all the  errors is that after reboot it would appear that no data was lost and  the backup could be resumed from where it advanced to just before the  crash the only thing that i can think that i did differently in these  new successful runs is that i did not sit at the computer and  watch can software detect being watched i think not but     my reading about esata gives me suspicion that it has its own poorly  documented problems im not convinced that i cannot make usb work  without smart but i really dont have any good ideas as to  how and now without errors happening fairly frequently i doubt that  i will be able to test and debug any approach that i dream up        the only other realistic option i know of is esata but a quick scan of   newegg shows only 6 devices total 2 dvr expander drives and 4 esata raid   enclosures  i have no idea if the dvr expander drives will work with a   standard pc setup  they should  the two dvr drives are both 1tb and both   just under 130 usd one iomega and one western digital      httpwwwneweggcomproductproductaspxitemn82e16822186175   httpwwwneweggcomproductproductaspxitemn82e16822136384      are you planning on connecting this drive to a laptop or desktop  to   multiple computers or just one computer    this is for a lan of desktop systems three computers in all one  computer acts as a collector of backups from the itself and the other  two and is responsible for getting the files onto an external drive  in a timely way    all of the computers are handmedowns none have esata capability so  far i have not convinced myself that spending money would help solve  the problem perhaps in a few years computers with esata will start  showing up in dumpsters maybe i should just wait       paul e condon             pecondonmesanetworksnet         to unsubscribe email to debianuserrequestlistsdebianorg   with a subject of unsubscribe trouble contact listmasterlistsdebianorg  archive httplistsdebianorg20100411214050gf10774biglangnu      ,ham,ham

re baseline raising chickens the hightech waythosstewaolcom writes   in a message dated 7232002 60227 pm dlsilcomcom writes    if were willing to count artificial  selection as genetic engineering     of course was genetic engineering it used the fundamental mechanism of   genetics inheritance of traits and not randomly but   intentionallybreeding for long fur fat hams whatever the degree to which   the engineersfarmers breedersunderstood exactly how the mehcanism works   is only marginally relevant to the question of whether it was engineering   naw i still disagree again because if im going to be so loose with the definitions then id have to say that i myself am a genetically engineered organism  but im natural baby  my parents were attracted to each others phenotypes mixed some genes in the hopes that those genotypes would get in there and grew me around them  sure they engineered the process when they selected each other  but they didnt engineer the genetics  if genetic enginering wasnt such an important topic today it wouldnt be such an important distinction  i guess that the reason that i disagree is that some groups arguing against any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument  weve been doing it since prehistory so we dont need to apply any caution today    karl anderson      kramonkeyorg           httpwwwmonkeyorgkra httpxentcommailmanlistinfofork   ,ham,ham

re entrepreneurson sat 20020824 at 0804 gregory alan bolcer wrote  theres been well documented articles studies of the  french tax laws corporate governance and financial  oversight that 1 dont easily allow for isos the root  of almost all entrepreneurialship and 2 the easy flow  of capital to new ventures  it was an extremely large  issue even debated widely in france   it is actually a lot worse than this  what it boils down to is that only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company  what i found fascinating is that the old french aristocracy effectively still exists literally the same families but they now hold top executive and management positions in the major french firms and the government positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods not officially of course but as a strict matter of practice  and the laws and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place  even for a young french blue blood strict age hierarchies keep them from branching out into a new venture in their own country though many can leverage this to start companies in other countries  i know about the french system firsthand and the executives are quite candid about it at least to yanks like me who are working with them but i suspect this may hold true for other european countries as well    after all those revolutions france is still nothing more than a thinly veiled oldschool aristocracy with all the trappings  james rogers  jamesrbestcom    ,ham,ham

requestfrommr joe mark email fax 1 561 619 2791 emailmrjoemarkyahoocom  dear sir   request for urgent business relationship β€“ strictly confidential   firstly i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and β€top secretβ€ though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day   we have decided to contact you first by your email due to the urgency of this transaction as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you so we decided it is best using the email let me start by first introducing myself properly to you i am dr kaku opa a director general in the ministry  of mines and power and i head a threeman tender board appointed by the government of the federal republic of nigeria to award contracts to individuals and companies and to approve such contract payments in the ministry of mines and power the duties of the committee also include evaluation vetting and monitoring of work done by foreign and local contractors in the ministry  i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds   the source of this funds is as follows between 1996 and 1997 this committee awarded contracts to various contractors for engineering procurement supply of electrical equipments such as transformers and some rural electrification projects   however these contracts were overinvoiced by the committee thereby leaving the sum of us115million dollars eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars in excess this was done with the intention that the committee will share the excess when the payments are approved   the federal government have since approved the total contract sum which has been paid out to the companies and contractors concerned which executed the contracts leaving the balance of 115m dollars which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe offshore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst ourselves  we need your assistance as the funds are presently secured in an escrow account of the federal government specifically set aside for the settlement of outstanding payments to foreign contractors we are handicapped  in the circumstances as the civil service code of conduct does not allow us to operate offshore accounts hence your importance in the whole transaction   my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf you or your company will retain 20 of the total amount of us1150000000 eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars while 70 will be for us members of this panel and the remaining 10 will be used in offsetting all debtsexpenses incurred both local and foreign in the cause of this transfer needless to say the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous in return we demand your complete honesty and trust   it does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here the assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies  more often than not big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts we are civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a life time opportunity  you must however note that this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and conditions as we have stated below as we have heard confirmed cases of business associates running away with funds kept in their custody when it finally arrive their accounts we have decided that this transaction will be based completely on the following   a our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence   b that you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality   c that upon receipt of the funds you will promptly release our share 70 on demand after you have removed your 20 and all expenses have been settled   d you must be ready to produce us with enough information about yourself to put our minds at rest   please note that this transaction is 100 legal and risk free and we hope to conclude the business in ten bank working days from the date of  receipt of the necessary information and requirement from you   endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my email fax number 1 561 619 2791 or my email address mrjoemarkyahoocom i will bring you into the complete picture of the transaction when i have heard from you   your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we are already behind schedule for this financial quarter   thank you and god bless   yours faithfully   mr joe mark   do you yahoo launch  your yahoo music

subject managing enron  s relationships with the universities  jeff   i would like to get on your calendar  together with jeff shankman  for 15   30 minutes  to discuss the results of my visit at the wharton school with tom piazze   a separate message about this visit will follow   i would like also to talk to you about the way we manage our relationships  with  different universities  historically  we were rather passive customers of  the academic institutions  trying to hire the best students and limiting our  presence  on the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions   we should rethink the way we work with universities  the efforts to get  the best students look more and more like a hand  to  hand combat and often we  are not  very successful  it is critical that we increase our presence on the campuses  and this can be accomplished in a number of different ways   1  involvement in research projects  for example  we are currently  underwriting two research  projects at stanford university  involving ph  d  students of professor  nicholas bambos   a top expert on communications networks   we shall participate in formulation  of the projects  objectives and will be given access to the results   involvement in research projects allows us to obtain  access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and  also to lock  up some very  promising students  most companies in the high tech industries have such  programs   2  lectures and presentations by enron employees  practically every  presentation  i have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes  and hiring decisions   it is important that students get exposed to enron early in their academic  program  in many cases   the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach  them during their  senior years   3  visits by faculty members in enron   closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to  getting the best students  and obtaining access to current research  the universities are very important  in shaping public opinion  on the issues critical to enron  s future  especially in the area of  deregulation and design of new markets    currently  the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on  personal commitment of a number  of overworked enron employees  in many cases  there is no continuity and  focus   i want to recommend a creation of a special function  vp or md level   responsible for coordinating  our relationships with the universities  this function would be separate from  our analyst  associate  program  i have many ideas how this function could be structured   vince,ham,ham

selling wedded bliss was re ouchan alternative to the kind of defeminized oversized selfcentered mercenaryminded lady available on the british singles scene  glad to see american culture is making its way into the british bars too  god bless us uncivilized bastards every one  still definately something not right about the below people are now cheaper then a decent laptop ok so we knew that already    selling wedded bliss big business in thailand thu aug 291019 am et by andrew marshall  bangkok thailand reuters  english dentist ken moylan came to thailand looking for a wife it took two hours to find her  the first day i went out with wan she came back to my hotel and hung all my clothes up and tidied the room i thought it was marvelous he said i knew then there was something special  moylan 49 is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet  and marry  thai women he lives in england now with 28yearold wan who is expecting their first child  critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women in developing countries offering dreams of a new life in the west that often turn sour but moylan says he has no regrets about coming to thailand in search of a wife  i got to thailand at 2 pm and by 4 pm id met wan he said i knew i found her attractive i could tell straight away that she was very caring  moylan spent a week in thailand and after returning to england kept in touch with wan by phone and mail six months later she came to england and the couple married  mr marriage  lawrence lynch 49 runs thai professional introduction services the agency moylan used to meet his wife lynch who calls himself mr marriage started the company after also marrying a thai woman through an introduction agency  since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages  in the last five years weve done about 400 he said to the best of my knowledge they have all been successful  male clients pay 2213 for the service although men from countries that require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of thai women looking for a husband if they like what they see they come to bangkok  clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in lynchs office  encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and language problems  we find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies lynch said but once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax  after the first meeting couples can decide to go on dates to get to know each other better within two weeks of arrival lynch says almost every client has found a potential wife  at the end of a fortnight its very very rare for a guy to go back and think he hasnt made his mind up he said in most cases marriage follows usually within the next year  roongthip kamchat managing director of thai no 1 connections a bangkokbased agency says she has introduced about 1000 couples and less than 10 percent have broken up  roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just arrived in bangkok looking for a wife  sometimes they are very nervous she said and sometimes they are very impatient and say give me a lady i want to get married now i say calm down ok well talk  but if men are really in a hurry roongthip says she can find them a wife and get them married within a week lynch says clients he has found wives for include a blind man a man with one leg and a man with posttraumatic stress disorder  why  similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries critics say they thrive on the neediness of lonely western men who are unable to form relationships in their own country and on the desperation of impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the west  but moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy there is no reason to object if you talk about people who are needy i think everybody wants someone to love them and wants someone to love so yes i need wan he said  thai women are dissatisfied with life in thailand i think theres no secret there they are looking for a better life i dont have a problem with that in return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to their future husband  lynch says men are dissatisfied with western women too and that is why they choose to use his agency  his brochure promises an alternative to the kind of defeminized oversized selfcentered mercenaryminded lady available on the british singles scene and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are not gods gift to women  roongthip said many western men found it difficult to meet women in their own countries  and found thai women attractive  they dont know how to meet women even if they go to pubs or discotheques or restaurants or department stores how can they ask people to marry them impossible she said  many thai girls are slim have long hair black eyes small nose they are good at taking care and joking and laughing not strict different from ladies from other countries  although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap the agencies say this is not a problem they say language problems are also not a major obstacle  thai ladies are not ageist and they have no qualms whatsoever about having a husband who is significantly older lynch said when i met my wife she couldnt speak a word of english we muddled along with a phonetic dictionary the ladies are very keen to learn english and they pick it up very quickly  many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move to the west  we have kitchens we have study classes roongthip said we teach them how to eat and when to make tea  pitfalls  but not all dreams come true bee is a 26yearold thai woman who went to switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency now she is back in bangkok sad and angry  he had no friends and i was so lonely she said i tried to make him happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean he never spoke to me  bee came back to bangkok earlier this year i thought i would be happy there she said but it was the worst time of my life  lynch says that while some agencies are badly run he makes checks to ensure unsuitable candidates are weeded out  we are ethical and professional he said we will not take on all comers  moylan says that despite possible pitfalls his own marriage is proof the arrangement can work wans sister has just signed up with lynchs company looking for a foreign husband  perhaps there are cases of women being exploited im sure there are moylan said but in the majority of cases the women get a good deal    ,ham,ham

i did my dissertation work in this area optimistic computing and so was  interested in applying it to the security problem unfortunately you hit a  bunch of problems        a when can you commit a state as being good  you cant run from  a  redo log forever the performance and storage penalties accumulate even  log  structured file systems garbage collect eventually so you have to commit  sometime the problem is that if you commit too eagerly you might commit  corrupted state if you commit too conservatively you eat performance and  storage penalties      b what do you do if you discover that there is corrupted state in the  middle of your redo log and you want some of the critical state that  comes after it you need some way to dig the corruption out of the middle  and save the rest my dissertation solves this problem but you have to  rewrite everything in my programming language       c just doing this at all imposes substantial performance penalties i  love vmware and use it every day the best 200 i ever spent on software  but it is not very fast    my proposed solution to the first two problems you mention is to be less  ambitious the idea is that you never commit  instead you simply revert  to base state on reboot obviously you cant do this with partitions that  accrue important state eg a partition that stores database table data  but in your typical web application most partitions do not accrue important  state for example your typical web server or application server could have  their entire state reset back to a known base state during each reboot  without harm  the advantage of being less ambitious is that we have a quick and easy way  to frustrate certain attacks without rewriting all of our software or  spending lots of money on additional applicationspecific coding    the first two problems you describe only occur if we become more ambitious  and try to apply these same techniques to for example the database table  partitions where state changes remain important across reboots that would  certainly be a nice touch but as you point out many problems would have to  be addressed first and the hardest of these can not be abstracted away from  the particular application not the least of these is the problem of writing  heuristics for delineating good from malevolent state that task is roughly  analogous to what antiviral software authors do for a living only this work  could not be shared across many different systems as it would be specific to  a paritcular application    the third problem you mention  performance penalty  is an argument for  doing this in hardware much like hardware raid another argument for doing  this in hardware is hack resistance changing the base instance should  require physical access to the console eg by requiring that you first  flip a physical switch on your raid hardware or modify a bios setting if  the base image can be modified remotely or by software then you have to  worry about whether an implementation flaw might permit a cracker to modify  the base image remotely    ben                                                                 scott mackenzie dine college isd       c

the build should be ok the new menu was  added but some configuration files may be better with new or different  defaults    feedback is very welcome  it works very nice would you consider upgrading it to 126 released only a few hours after your build  thanks  on tue oct 08 2002 at 014911pm 0200 renaud deraison wrote  im pleased to announce the availability of nessus 126 which should  be one of the last versions of nessus 12x hopefully as i will soon  open a new unstable tree and start to break things again     what is new in nessus 126 in comparison to 125      changes by michael slifcak michaelslifcak at guardentcom        added bugtraq cross reference in the plugins        added support for bid in nessusd this has yet to be done on         the client side            changes by axel nennker axelnennker at tsystemscom        fixed the xml and html outputs        fixed array issues in a couple of plugins          changes by michel arboi arboi at bigfootcom        findservice now

  fixed a bug which may make nasl interpret backquoted strings         n and r received from the network problem noted by pavel         kankovsky        nmapwrappernes calls exit instead of exit         solved the lack of bpfs on freeopennetbsd and macosx by         sharing one among all the nessus processes as a result         nessuss ping is much more effective on these platforms        bugfix in plugsetkey which would eventually make some         scripts take too long when writing in the kb        plugins of family actsettings are run after plugins of         family actscanners        replaced the implementation of md5 which was used when         openssl is disabled by the one from rsa the old one would         not work on a bigendian host        fixed plugins build issues on macos x        the nessus client compiles and links against gtk20 of         course it will be horrible and unstable as the gtk team         does not care about backward compatibility       these two

securing multiple virtual hostsi am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our apache server we are not taking credit card orders or users personal information but are merely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users we are not running any secure applications on the root host  i have been testing this week with ca client and host certificate requests certificates and keys and think i have a fairly good beginners grasp of the commands and command line options   my questions are  1  is it necessary to create a ca certificate for each of the secure virtual hosts or can one ca certificate for the root be used to sign each of the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure  2  even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions am i correct in configuring the server with a cacertificatefile in the main body of httpsdconf and then setting the cacertificatefile for each virtual host in the  section of httpsdconf  this sort of assumes the answer to 1 is   you need a ca for each virtual host  3  is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our users or is it sufficient to have the ca certificate and a server certificate for the virtual hosts  wouldnt a client certificate only be necessary if we were trying to verify the clients identity  would that be a good idea given our scenario  thanks in advance for your help    openssl project                                 httpwwwopensslorg user support mailing list                    opensslusersopensslorg automated list manager                           majordomoopensslorg  ,ham,ham

judicial judgementschild support                  bgs xxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxthank you for your interest  judgment courses offers an extensive training course in how to collect moneyjudgments  if you are like many people you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income   if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them  you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact its now up to you to collect on the judgment the court does not require the loser to pay you the court will not even help you you must trace the loser down find their assets their employment bank accounts real estate stocks and bonds etc  very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten  in 79 of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime  the nonpayment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt  for every judgment that is paid 5more judgments take its place  we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since we invented this business we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed  with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments  by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments  the income potential is substantial in this profession we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making 9600000 to over 20000000 per year part time associates are earning between 2400000 and 10000000 per year  some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices  today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing of this 126 million 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates joint ventures are where we make our money we only break even when our course is purchased we make a 12 margin on the reports we supply to our associates our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies police officers attorneys credit agencies etc all come to us for reports   many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off the norm is 10 interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments annual interest on 5 million at 10 translates to 50000000 annually in interest income not counting the payment of the principal  our associates earn half of this amount or 25000000 per year this is just for interest not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 25 million dollars  92 of all of our associates work out of their home 43 are women and 36 are part time   one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go the judgments you are working on will be there when you return the judgments are still in force they do not disappear  the way we train you is nonconfrontational you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing you never confront the debtor the debtor doesnt know who you are you are not a collection agency  simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows  mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments we train you how to find out who to write to  8 to 11 of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help they call you you dont call them unless you want to  you send them an agreement supplied in the course to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 to you and 50 to them this applies no matter if the judgment is for 200000 or 200000000  you then go online to our computers to find the debtor and their assets we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus to bank account locates employment locates skip traces and locating stocks and bonds etc the prices of our reports are very low typically 12 to 13 of what other firms charge for example we charge 600 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge 2500  once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course  when you receive the assets you keep 50 and send 50 to the original judgment holder  once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court included in the course  quotes from several of our students  thomas in area code 516 writes us i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course my first week part time will net me 370000 dollars your professionalism in both the manual and your support   you have the video opened doors for me in the future  theres no stopping me now recently

this to grow to twice this amountwithin the next year i am having a ball i have over 250000 in judgments i am collecting on now  after having our course for 7 months larry s in 314 stated i am now making 1200000 per month and have approximately 50000000 in judgments i am collecting on looks like i will have to hire someone to help out  marshal in area code 407 states to us i feel bad you only charged me 25900 for this course and it is a goldmine i have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months  from the above information and actual results you can see

re a moment of silence for the first amendment fwdbill stoddard wrote  gab the problem is that politics have gotten so muddied gab nowadays that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting gab political rallies that you dont agree with has become gab common practice  the courts have constantly ruled gab that there are some restrictions on the first amendment gab they teach you that your very first year of law school  ill agree with owen on this one  muddied my ass  how hard is it to chose between a republocrat or a demipublican   not very  shouting down has grown to become the answer because the government over a span of years and with the help of the courts has limited the rights we have as citizens under the first amendment        wishful thinking people are just bigger dickheads now culture is changing and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down when you disagree with them  the people that do this are not disenfranchised they get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes the act of protesting is more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these people     in my experience this is classic american behaviour and i dont  think its on the increase outside of the us of a i am willing to accept the premise that americans are bigger dickheads  then they used to be  owen      ,ham,ham

subject enron europe organisational changes  once the arcos plant in spain is financially closed  expected in q 2 of this  year  eric gonzales will be moving back to houston to work exclusively on  co  managing enron  s lng markets  we are very appreciative of eric  s efforts  in europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very  closely with his lng team in the coming years  from this point forward eric  will focus his remaining time in europe exclusively on financially closing  arcos   we are therefore making the following changes immediately  the origination  responsibility for italy will be moved under eric shaw  ricardo bortolloti  will continue in the role as italian country manager and will report to eric  shaw  mariano gentilini will become our country manager for spain and  portugal and will report directly to the enron europe office of the chairman   the arcos power project is likely to create a large gas to power spread  position and so we have asked paul mead to assume the added responsibility  for our natural gas risk positions in spain  this position is much more  likely to be supplied and influenced by lng rather than continental gas  markets and paul will work quite closely with both enron global markets and  the continental gas team   ross sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in holland will also  head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power  transmission opportunities across europe  among the prospects his team will  pursue include projects from norway to the uk  sweden to the continent   and bidding on existing french interconnector capacity  he will report to  eric shaw for the holland markets and to richard lewis for the transmission  responsibilities   finally the continental gas team is interacting far more with our uk gas team  than our power teams on the continent  therefore david galagher who manages  our continental gas team will now report directly to richard lewis   we have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that these  changes will create the right links to optimize our performance  please help  make these changes as smooth as possible   john sherriff  michael brown,ham,ham

by mike mccurry and larry purpuro  not many months from now people across the country will experience one  of the great recurring features of american democracy at shopping  malls on factory floors at church socials and even on our front  stoops we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in  public office while chances are high that we wont know them  personally they will walk up to us offer a handshake and a flier and  ask for our votes  just as technology is affecting every other area of communication it  has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters  in this years gop gubernatorial primary california secretary of state  bill jones who faced betterfunded candidates acquired the email  addresses of more than a million potential california voters and sent  each an unsolicited email asking for support  that day he might have chosen any of the more traditional  and more  expensive  methods of contacting voters such as direct mail radio  spots or tv ads but he spent only about 2 cents per message instead of  35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium  had jones chosen direct mail radio or tv that communication would have  been equally unsolicited as defined in the email world few voters  would have opted in to receive campaign information from jones  through any of those channels  the response to jones email effort however was swift and intense he  was lambasted by antispam advocates and media coverage was almost  entirely negative to be fair some of jones tactics could have been  refined he used a lessthanperfect list and no standardpractice  paid for disclaimer in the message  his detractors however attacked him not for his tactical miscues but  because the email was sent unsolicited in fact jones online campaign  may have been his most visible asset in an era of cynicism toward money  in politics  money typically spent on other unsolicited communication  mediums  jones tried to level the playing field  no one likes commercial spam it is irrelevant and untargeted and can be  highly intrusive and even offensive but as a sophisticated society  its time to differentiate commercial spam from very different  unsolicited email sent by political candidates to voters  the debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in congress  that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam we  believe email is no more intrusive than direct mail telemarketing or  tv advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters a  simple link in good email campaigns allows recipients to opt out of  future mailings direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be  taken off a list and viewers must repeatedly endure tv ads  when a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest he or she can use the  internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them  to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes with more than 60  percent of all potential voters in this country possessing email  accounts it makes sense that political candidates use this medium  candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the  jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better  ensure quality of email lists and target content to specific recipient  groups  but the broader point remains when a political candidate sends a voter  an email that recipient can choose to delete the message without  opening it unsubscribe from the list read it or even reply and engage  the sender that choice should belong to the voter  not to antispam  advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial email  political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best  they can and let voters decide what to do with that information    mike mccurry former press secretary for president clinton is ceo of an  advocacy management and communications software company larry purpuro  the

re baseline raising chickens the hightech wayelias sinderson  writes   sorry karl your confusing things  no its just a silly discussion but thats what picky semantic discussions turn into    thos is saying that selective   breeding should be counted as genetic engineering whereas you are   extending his definition to include the attration that your parents felt  yes im saying that if he extends genetic engineering to include selecting animals to breed he must extend it to include selecting people to breed with   unless your parents were selectively bred like livestock to produce you   i dont think you can make that case    im saying that my parents selected each other and that they did so because among other reasons each wanted the others genes to be mixed with their own in the offspring that they were planning  what does it matter that they were selecting to produce their own offspring rather than the offspring of two unrelated animals    karl anderson      kramonkeyorg           httpwwwmonkeyorgkra httpxentcommailmanlistinfofork   ,ham,ham

re 250 weirdnessok i have since verified that sometimes i lose focus and sometimes x11 pops  to the front even when another application is runing for example im using  powerpoint and thengee all my xterms hello xterms but powerpoint  still has focus in the sense that my keypresses go to powerpoint which is  hidden behind my xterms    but heres the thingthis all started with 250 this bug is not present  in the snow leopard standard install so perhaps there is something  xquartzapp can do about it    adam    on sun 4 apr 2010 jeremy huddleston wrote     you guys might want to cc yourself to this ticket      httpxquartzmacosforgeorgtracticket58      the issue cant really be fixed by xquartzapp itself  if this is an   annoyance i suggest you file a bug report with apple

have had beforebut not   since upgrading to snow leopard      only minorly relatedly i would say that loss of focus is the single most   annoying thing that occurs in my use of osx broadly speaking whether its a   dialog box or a new window or anything if i didnt click on it or somehow   intentionally direct myself to it i really dont want to be typing in there   instead of where i chose to be      is there any software anyone has heard of that can turn off the ability of   any program to steal focus      adam      on sun 4 apr 2010 doug carter wrote         for what its worth ive seen this and a related problem since   232 ive always suspected that its a conflict between a os window   manager event and the x server the related problem is sometimes a   currently inuse xterm will lose focus for 13 seconds sometimes the   focus returns other times i need to click in the xterm to get the   focus back      ive always assumed these problems were at a deeper event level and   because they are so random and impossible to reproduce ive just lived   with them like the ticket referenced below id say its a good bet that   there is some other process that is messing with focus      doug

that i have upgraded to 250 when im typing   in an xterm for some reason all of the windows open in xquartzapp will   come forward for example if this window is the only one above firefox    in   the background for some reason and in a manner i cannot yet predict or   cause all of the other windows will come forward as if i had clicked the   xquartz icon in the dock     	the windows order is not being rearrangedthis window stays on   top  im not losing any keystrokes  its annoying when im typing here    and   reading a webpage     	this was not an issue under apples x11 for 106 it only happens   once every few hours so i dont know if it happened during the short    period   of time during which i used rc1 or rc2     	ill certainly write back if i have any way to reproduce it but for

quotedemailtext 	version250cvs xspamlevel   oh they were plenty upset about the tea taxes  but the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the american colonies  and btw england as well  dear ben franklin was right for the wrong reasons  first of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to england proper  second the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement  in fact it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim  it sounds like a modern keynsian was creating an urban legend  otoh the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling  imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering ious on your own name  and then trying to market  exchange the paper as the merchant who took the iou    the most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money  the effects are a complete disaster  there are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid  so almost all the literature talks about that  but you can also screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation  the fundamental cause of the american great depression was exactly this courtesy of the federal reserve board  i dont think shifting the power to print money to the bank of canada had much effect  and canada is still a prosperous country      original message

clear      f examples    china  ooops no wait scratch that    there is one counter example that i can think of but it may not be  precisely free trademarkets  when ben franklin first visited  england he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous  ben  explained that they used colonial script a kind of barterdollar  and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment  the  british bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to  clamp down on the practice  within a few years the colonies were  rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the empire    according to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political  party here in canada the founding fathers had no real complaint about  tea taxes it was the banning of colonial script they were  protesting if this is true then it comes right back to the forces  that killed ned ludds followers as to why popular opinion believes  they were protesting a tea tax  the same pamphlet claimed that canada  was also a prosperous nation until by an act of parliament in the  late50s or early 60s the right to print money was removed from the  juristiction of parliament and handed over to the bank of canada    ive wondered about all this  certainly the timeline of the collapse  of the canadian economy fits the profile but there are oodles of  other causes for example spending money like we had

wwwbbccouk   tuesday 8 october 2002 0943 gmt 1043 uk    fake bank website cons victims    west african criminals have used a fake version of a british banks online  service to milk victims of cash say police the fake site was used to squeeze  more money out of people they had already hooked     the site has been shut down but uk national criminal intelligence service  ncis said at least two canadians had lost more than 100000 after being  taken in by the fake website     the scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a  share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various african  nations     ncis said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would  otherwise spot the scam     convincing site     news of this latest scam was revealed by bbc radio5live it found that an  unclaimed web domain of a uk bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out  their victims    a ncis spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had the in  front of the banks name     i have seen the microsite myself and its very sophisticated said the ncis  spokesman its very convincing especially to people not very experienced  online     once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down however the people  behind it have not been caught     ncis does know that at least two people have lost more than 100000     the bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many  other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again    domain games     usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as advanced fee or  419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or email offering a share of any  cash successfully moved out of africa     the 419 refers to the part of the nigerian penal code dealing with such  crimes     like any con there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking  the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe  uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash     although this con has been practiced for years people still fall victim to  it     ncis estimates that up to five americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in  london everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con     cutting edge fraud     often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of  legitimacy       people tricked into clicking on fake sites    but a spokesman for ncis said fake or spoof websites are now being used in  place of the certificates     to many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web  technology said the spokesman     one of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website  that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the south african  reserve bank the countrys national bank     typically victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to  visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has  been deposited in their name     but before they can get their hands on the cash the victims are typically  asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead     once the south african police discovered the ruse they declared it a national  priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it     modern gloss     an briefing paper prepared by ncis in august on organised crime noted that  criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give  old cons a modern gloss     the ncis spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come  forward and help it track down the perpetrators he said in the last two  months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud     he said any email fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be  true undoubtedly is     one of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment  service paypal     conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and reenter their account  and credit card details because paypal had lost the information     the website link included in the email looked legitimate but in fact directed  people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmens personal use     yahoo groups sponsor  sell a home for top  httpusclickyahoocomrrpzmcjtmeaamvfiaa7gsolbtm   to unsubscribe from

subject energy leader consulting generation evaluator  ege   shirley   as requested  herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski   the presentation on the ege tool  s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour  if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday  may 29  might i request it be set for late afternoon  as my other appointments are the next day    and  as vince will recall  i was co  leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly  and developer of the ramp up  real time  75 check and electric strategy tools  presently  i am ceo of energy leader consulting  elc    background  the u  s  power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years  rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively  utilities  who still control most power plants  endeavor to adopt the entrants  methods  yet  inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread   utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades  old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling  many utilities  notwithstanding the industry  wide trend towards profit maximization  cling to ingrained routines   inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale  a utility may operate a relatively small system  fewer than a dozen plants   a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers  playing the wholesale market at the margin   for a variety of reasons  utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units  let alone shut down any  even temporarily or seasonally   economically inefficient units continue to be committed  week after week  and run in the half  load range   ege objectives  ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines  taking into account transmission and reliability factors  the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant   i  an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long  term wholesale power transaction with a utility  or to price wholesale power more aggressively  to take market share from the utility  i  e   compel changes in unit commitment habits    ii  an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition   iii  a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility  s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized   specific ege concepts  ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities   it produces indicative statistics such as   a  the frequency distribution of starts per week   b  the frequency distribution of starts by day  15  minute segment during the week   c  the frequency distribution of load level   d  the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start   e  average heat rate and approximate fully  allocated cost in the half  load range   f  average ramp rate from the half  load range   g  the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours  and  h  forced  off maintenance outage rate  where indicated    indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month  year  in some cases  by temperature range   they can be by regional wholesale prices as well   ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years   ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data  ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000  through december 31  2000   ege lst quarter 2000  through march 31  2001  will be available approximately june 15  2001   ege also compares and ranks generating units  commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility  as well as other regional generators   some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half  load level for lengthy time periods  without an apparent reliability basis   splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units   other ege supporting data   i  planned maintenance schedule  where indicated    j  actual maximum generating capacity   k  actual minimum generating capacity  actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government  reported values    l  average heat rate in the full  load range  and  m  average heat rate in the three  quarter  load range   with respect to a generating units  average heat rate in the half  load  three  quarter  load and full  load ranges  it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region  it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities  and changes in recent years in these parameters   the real  world example of allegheny energy  allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege  in the 4 th quarter 2000  for instance  one high  cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning  52 times  and committed for the whole day  in all but two cases   arguably  there are power products that could substitute for this routine  in part at least  at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy   another high  cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn  nine times  and committed for most of the coming week  at another plant  two high  cost units were operated too often in the expensive half  load range  some 550 hours  and three  quarter  load range  another 400 to 600 hours   they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels  again  there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy   offering of energy leader consulting  elc   ege is a procedure  not a software package or data base  elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities   elc transfers its  knowledge  about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight  forward four  step process   1  enron would select one to three target utilities   2  elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities   3  employing this real  world analysis as a pedagogic tool  elc  in a one  day seminar with enron personnel  would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future  without the assistance of elc    4  optionally  elc would provide ege supporting data  quarterly  to enron   the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program  virtually all fossil fuel units   parameters that are incorporated  and the data set format  will be specified upon request  custom modifications will be considered   steven a  mitnick  chief executive officer  energy leader consulting  4807 41 st street  nw  washington  dc 20016   202  997  0924 voice   202  537

window manager and see if i can get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries i dont have this problem with any other windows though just the exmhunseen window   how about enabling the show unseen message count in folder cache option it displays the number of unseen messages next to each folder name if greater than 0 so you dont really need the unseen window unless youre using more sequences than just unseen  paul  	as hal noted i like to have the unseen window visible in all virtual desktops even if the main window is minimized however i looked through all the preferences menus and didnt see anything resembling show unseen message count in folder cache where is that and in what version im running v24  06232000  creaky i know  	i went into twm with no virtual desktops and it came up just fine going back to enlightenment i saw the same behavior as before then i knew it must be something in the window manager so i went digging in my  englightenmentesessionxxxxxxsnapshots0 file i found all the settings that e uses for remembering border styles positions shaded state etc  	i have a 1600x1200 screen and it kept putting my window at 1655x150 and had it shaded to boot so it was tiny as well as offscreen 	searching for unseen in that file found this section  new exmhexmh name exmh class exmh new unseenunseenwin name unseen class unseenwin desktop 0 res 1600 1200 wh 114 173 xy 1655 150 0 0 layer 4 sticky 1 skiptask 0 skipwinlist 0 skipfocus 0 shade 2 border pagerleftblue  	i changed xy 1655 150 0 0  	to  xy 1455 150 0 0	so it would reappear in my viewable space restarted enlightenment ctrlaltend and then restarted exmh bingo there was my window   	i quickly told englightenment to forget everything about that window except is border style and now have a sveldt little entry like so  new exmhexmh name exmh class exmh new unseenunseenwin name unseen class unseenwin border pagerleftblue  	completely an enlightenment problem not exmh though i wonder how it got mixed up in the first place i certainly cant move a window off screen like that unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when shading  	hmm weird   	anyway thanks for the suggestions folks hopefully

1000 bill inside the sheet of paper insert the paper and 1000 bill into an envelope address the envelope with the name and address of the person whose name is shown under each guide below and mail the

how to sharpen your mind order guide  5 for us1000 cash from  j siden krondikesvagen 54 a 83147 ostersund sweden  end of list of five names  step 2  these guides will be emailed to you  save these guides on your computers hard disk as other people will be ordering these guides from you paying you for them and you will need to email the guides to the new buyers  step 3  from the list of names above delete the name and address of the person shown under guide5 and replace that slot with the name and address of the person from guide 4s slot  be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown check the address again  step 4  delete name and address under guide 4 and replace with the name and address from guide 3s slot  step 5  delete name and address under guide 3 and replace with the name and address from  guide2s slot  step 6  delete name and address under guide 2 and replace with the name and address from guide 1s slot  step 7  delete name and address under guide 1 and replace with your own name and address this step is how your own name and address is entered into the list of names to receive orders for the guides eventually your own name will go down the list of names until you have reached guide 5 and then be dropped from the list the key point is that the number of people ordering guides from you will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes  step 8  once you have completed this new list send out this new email which shows your name under guide 1 to as many email addresses as possible as many as 100000 emails or even more  the greater the number of mailings you make potentially the greater the number of people who will order the guide 1 from you  these people will then make new emails to send out to their addresses with the email showing your name under guide 2 and so on  this is all you need to do  if you wish to read the rest of this email message then do so  if not just do the 8 steps shown above remember the key point is to send out as many emails as possible in step 8 and to encourage and help those who purchase the guides from you to send out emails of their own  do not change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you  your immediate reaction might be why not replace all the names on the list with the names of your spouse kids relatives and friends that might seem to you like a clever move because new buyers will be sending their money to these people  but that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit what will benefit you most is having people who will send out emails seek new buyers and provide assistance to new buyers if the people you slip into that list arent going to be sending new emails youre only hurting yourself by effectively closing down the program with your name on top of the list of the names that you have inserted  there wouldnt be new buyers coming in so your sly maneuver will gain you exactly zero  furthermore if you have done the work and your name has worked its way to further down the list by then you deserve the rewards and earnings from that effort and it would be unethical for anyone to remove your name for whatever reason  dont do it to others remember honesty reaps the reward  you may have a concern that after sending the total 50 to the five people on the list that one of the people will just take your money and not send you the guide  well rest assured  as we said above its to our benefit to have you as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find new buyers  so dont think the people on the list will try to cheat you or to stiff you for 1000  the people on the list would rather have you working hard because your effort will benefit them as well as you  later on when other buyers send you the order to buy the guides fulfill your end of the deal by sending the ordered guide to the buyer  dont cheat provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit end of summary  rest of message  with easytouse email tools and optin email success in this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary people who may not have done any internet marketing before and the earnings potential is staggering  read this email to the end  follow what it says   and you will not worry whether a recession is coming or not or whether or not you can afford to buy that new car or home that you have been looking for  yes i know what you are thinking i never responded to one of these before either one day though something made me feel you use 50 going to a movie for 2 hours with your spouse friend or child plus a simple meat at a restaurant  why the heck not  no matter where you believe those feelings came from i thank every day that feeling came over me  i cannot imagine where i would be or what i would be doing had i not read on it works  and when you read the guides youβ€™ll learn how to become a more effective communicator what can be better  a way to improve your selfimage and confidence and at the same time have the potential to recover your investment and make some good money making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home if you work

reasonable period of time depending on the collective efforts of yourself and the others on the list of five    take this entire email with the modified list of names and save it on your computer do not make any other changes  there are 2 methods to get this venture going  method  1 by sending bulk email legally   lets say that you start small to see how it goes and that you and those involved send out only 5000 emails each lets also assume that the mailing receives only a 01 110 of 1 response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 01 also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only 5000 each  out of your 5000 emails and a 01 response that is only 5 orders for guide  1 those 5 people who responded also send out 5000 emails each for a total of 25000 out of those 25000 emails only 01 responded with orders thats 25 people who responded and ordered guide  2  those 25 people mail out 5000 emails each for a total of 125000 emails the 01 response to that is 125 orders for guide  3 those 125 people send 5000 emails each for a total of 625000 emails sent out the 01 response is 625 orders for guide  4  those 625 people send out 5000 emails each for a total of 3125000 emails the 01 response to that is  3125 orders for guide  5 or 31250 at 10 per guide  this may seem a small amount to you but remember we used a very low response rate with a small number of emails being sent out  see what happens if you can get the response rate up just slightly  if response rate is 01 income from guides 1  5 is 502501250625031250  39050 as above  if response rate is 015 income from guides 1  5 is 75560422031640237300  273795  if response rate is 02 income from guides 1  5 is 1001000100001000001000000  1111100  dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100000 emails each or more  from the example above you can see the power of leveraging that is how much greater is the amount of money from a small increase in the response rate  there are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day  method  2 placing free ads on the internet   advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are many free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will get a response we strongly suggest you start with  method  1 and add method  2 as you go along for every 10 you receive all you must do is email the guide the buyer ordered always provide same day service  the people you buy these guides from will assist and advise you how to get the large number of email addresses that you need to send the new email containing your name and address  in return when others buy the guides from you you also should help those buyers to resell the guides to their email addresses  this will benefit you because your name would be further down the list and their new buyers will buy from you  this is no different than customer service in the retail or the  bricks and mortars business  available guides  the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow  wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you  order each guide by its number  name only always send a single 10 bill us currency for each guide  checks not accepted make sure the cash is hidden by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number  the name of the guide you are ordering your email address and your name and postal address  be sure to address the envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to mail the envelope  place your order for these guides now from the name and address list shown at the beginning of this email  your success guidelines   if you do not receive at least 10 orders for guide 1 within 2 weeks continue sending emails until you do   two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders you should receive 100 orders or more for guide 2 if not continue advertising or sending emails until you do  once you have received 100 or more orders for guide  2 you can see the program is working and cash should continue coming in this is important to remember  continue to assist new buyers with advice and instruction on how to send out more emails you can keep track of progress by noting which guides people are ordering from you if you want to generate more income send another batch of emails and start the whole process again there is no limit to the income you can generate   a note from the originator of this program you have just received information that can give you financial freedom to really change your life but i dont wish to kid you  this requires a bit of effort you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined follow the program exactly as instructed  remember to email the revised copy of this email after you have put your name and address in guide1 and moved others to 2  5 slots as instructed above one of the people you send this to may send out 100000 or more emails and your name will be on every one of them remember the more you send out the more potential buyers you will reach  it is up to you  order the guides now and

re nonascii environmenton fri 9 apr 2010 175704 0400 edt john hasler wrote   stephen powell writes   yes hercules is an ibm mainframe emulator  but the problem is   licensing  there are some very old releases of ibm operating   systems that have passed into the public domain that you can run on   the hercules emulator   these are circa 1975 or so which is about 35 years ago  an example   is vmsp release 6    oops i meant to say vm370 release 6 not vmsp release 6  vmsp  release 6 is still proprietary        these are some of the issues that someone writing portable code  for ascii vs ebcdic implementations needs to worry about    1 collating sequence  in ascii the collating sequence is numbers  09 followed by uppercase letters az followed by lowercase  letters az  special characters are mixed throughout  in ebcdic  the collating sequence is lowercase letters az followed by  uppercase letters az followed by numbers 09  so records  sorted alphabetically sort in a different order    2 assumptions of continuity  in ascii the codes az and az  are contiguous with no codes in between  in ebcdic there are  six noncontiguous ranges ai jr sz ai jr sz  most  of the codes in between are nonprintable characters but not  all  for example  sorts above r and below s  sorts above i  and below j and  sorts above r and below s    3 hidden assumptions about control codes  a program may for  example assume that x0a is a line feed and hard code it  somewhere  in ascii that is true  but in ebcdic a line feed  is x25    4 7bit assumptions  in us standard ascii all the printable  characters are between the hex values of x00x7f  codes  above x7f are not standard codes  historically these indicate  the combination of the meta key with a regular code  in  ebcdic the codes are sprinkled throughout the entire range of  x00 through xff with the numeric symbol 9 having the highest  code of any normal printable character xf9    this is not an exhaustive list but it gives you an idea  of what to watch for  although the  following table has a few mistakes this link will give you  an idea of ascii vs ebcdic codes       httpwwwnaturalinnovationscomcomputingasciiebcdichtml              stephen powell                            to unsubscribe email to debianuserrequestlistsdebianorg   with a subject of unsubscribe trouble contact listmasterlistsdebianorg  archive httplistsdebianorg86916642246941270858506206javamailrootmd01wowsynacorcom      ,ham,ham

any chance of having that lengthen instead   i like all my exmh stuff    in nice columns fits the display better   that is i use the detache  d    folder list one column   the main exmh window takes up full screen    top to bottom but less than half the width etc    i thought about that  the first order approximation would be to just add   using pack  side top instead of pack  side left however since their   each a different width it would look funny  ive done this  its not as pretty as i think it should be but it works   im going to leave the cosmetic issues to others  when i update the  documentation ill add this to the exmhtodo file  im leaving for a 2 12 week vacation in a week so this is the last new  functionality im going to add for a while  also i now have pretty much

re snow leopard java 6 and netbeanshas anyone tried it with the 10m3050 or 9m3150 developer preview im   somewhat concerned that this is a demonstrable regression between java 5   and java 6  however there are several other factors that can impact   memory use     32 vs 64bit biggest culprit   15client32bit tuned garbage collection options running on   16server64bit   client vs server hotspot itself more aggressive compilation and   storage of compiled code    anecdotally ive talked to several people who have large long running   64bit processes on snow leopard with 2gbofram machines who were   having a miserable time while reverting to 32bit may be a quick fix   for some others who tuned the gc parameters or turned on   xxusecompressedoops which compresses java references to 32bit   values in the heap found that they could reclaim or even exceed their   original 32bit performance since they were still using the server   jvm    since someone mentioned that netbeans 69 beta was working well id   suggest taking a look at its jvm options and see if there wasnt some   tweaking done to optimize it for a 64bit by default world    best of luck  mike swingler  java runtime engineer  apple inc    on apr 23 2010 at 706 am dave minnigerode wrote     i too have been using netbeans 68 on 105 and 106 with the default   jvm doing java 6 work its just stable enough for daily use  i do   restart nb every few hrs when the memory use gets out of hand   apparently some object leaks with the apple jvmnb combo cant   switch it back to java 5 so kinda stuck with it so im probably just   going to switch to intillij ive found its performance to be a lot   better than nb overall   file tree nav is painless for example  20   im kinda sad about it but got work to get done  20   on apr 23

using matisse and using the swing application   framework with an embedded derby database though i will note that i   have issues even before any files are open just expanding the tree to   get to a file for opening tended to take about 10 seconds and thats   assuming i didnt switch to another window in the meantime  20   i just did a full wipereinstall of netbeans to see if my settings   were a problem but i had no change until i loaded in java 5 and saw a   significant difference ill be trying out the suggestions people made   about using a different target platform than the one netbeans is running   on but im starting to wonder if there is an issue with my system  20   on apr 23 2010 922am david loeffler  wrote   i use netbeans 69 beta i was using 68 but want the metadata   support for entity beans and i have no problems  i have a late 2007   mbp 17 and am using java version 16017   i am developing a java 6   running on glassfish using postgres as the database  this is a port of

have made no changes to the java or preferences for netbeans  of   course the java for my app is 16 and netbeans runs on 16 as well  20  20  20   i do see an increase in activity when there is an open dialog box so   i keep an eye out for them  i watch cpu activity since i had an issue   with kernel panics a month ago  turned out to be a combination of a   failing disk drive and a memory stick replaced the 160g drive with 500g   and the 2g stick with 4g to make total of 6g   apple store guys could   not see the problems but through some handy tools and taking to external   service personnel we were able to zero in on the problem and fix it  20  20  20   side note i have shutdown plugins in safari mainly to keep flash   from running  some sites caused flash plugin to push usage up to 20

i imagine this topic comes up every so often but i havent been   able to find it in the archives 46rom what i understand theres some   issue with snow leopard and java 6 that makes netbeans 68 near   unusable ive had to do my development on a lesserpowered pc because   there things will actually open without pegging the cpu at 100 and   becoming unresponsive following a tip i used pacifist to reinstall   leopards java 5 back onto the system set it as the default and tried   to launch netbeans lo and behold it was fast responsive and showed   none of the problems id been used to unfortunately it made it so that   i couldnt work on my java 6based app  20  20  20   so what is the actual situation here is this a known issue with   the apple jvm thats hopefully going to get fixed is this a bug in   netbeans am i the only one seeing issues this bad and so it could be a   problem with my setup is there a workaround any help would be vastly   appreciated  the windows box is having disk issues and id love to   move my primary development to the macbook pro as soon as possible and   if push comes to shove i may have to just rearchitect the project into   java 5 which would not be a simple task  20     20   do not post admin requests to the list they will be ignored  20   javadev mailing list      javadevlistsapplecom  20   helpunsubscribeupdate your subscription  20

pgp problem exmh hangs during query keyserveri guess the first question here should be does anyone have some updates to the pgp code in exmh that i should know about  my current problem is that if i get a pgp signed message i first get a button that reads 	check the signature with gnupg if i punch the button and i dont have the signature on my keyring then i get a message saying just that and the message 	cant check signature public key not found along with a button with the inscription 	query keyserver if i punch the button then exmh just hangs  forever  if instead of punching the button i go out to the keyserver myself and then try the message again everything works so it seems that it must be the code that goes out to the keyserver  anyone else with this problem this is exmh v25 and tcltk 84a4                                           regclemens                                         regdwfcom      exmhusers mailing list exmhusersredhatcom httpslistmanredhatcommailmanlistinfoexmhusers   ,ham,ham

suggestions for the pctel driver and at  the end of it everything still goes smoothly until i type make  after i get the output from the configure     however there were a couple of things i noticed along the way after typing    cp configskernel24config config   make oldconfig   make dep  the 2nd to last line i got back said that the modversionsh file was  not updated when i looked at this path to the modversionsh file it  was 281 lines and every line started with a  mark  is it the case  that nothing is read on a line after a  mark or am i just thinking  of another language and so should i delete the  at certain places no that is appropriate content for the file  im not a c programmer but i think that these sort of things include blahblah are instructions to the compiler processed by a preprocessor in the compile process and include all sorts of symbolsfunctions eg include mathh gives you maths type functions  since they start with  they are ignored in the final compilation  regarding the rest of the compile process you need to tell the pctel software to look in the right place for the kernel headerssource  i recall from your previous mail that there was a flag     withkernelincludesusrsrclinux24 which could be passed to the configure script with the appropriate directory in place of usrsrclinux24  this might allow you to persuade the code to compile against the correct headers  i think this is the right way to proceed  alternatively maybe the steps above regarding make dep and so forth should have been performed in the directory where the make process is looking for modversionsh  co  i dont think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as you describe below  first of all you will move modversionsh which you have done then you would have to move all those ver files after that there will almost certainly be a need for further header h files  this could be quickly done but is probably bad those files dont really belong there  for what its worth i think you are very close to a successful compilation  m     also when i was in the pctel directory and typed make i noticed  that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversionsh  file inside this other file theres nothing at all and so i moved  the modversionsh file with 281 lines to the empty modversionsh file   and got a different reply after make the output after i moved the  file over mostly looked like this  usrsrclinux24183linuxmodversionsh1133  linuxmodulesadbver no such file or directory  usrsrclinux24183linuxmodversionsh1237  linuxmodulesafax25ver no such file or directory  usrsrclinux24183linuxmodversionsh1336  linuxmodulesafipxver no such file or directory    the odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are  whats written after the  in the modversionsh file should there be  a file at each of these one at each of the 281 lines of the file  that id have to compilemake    michael conry   ph35317161987 web

subject alliance info alert  ferc reporting  attached is a summary of recent ferc activities  pdf file  and the weekly  alliance express  the following is a summary of the most recent ferc meeting   followed by a listing of the most recent ferc filings   in a brief meeting yesterday  ferc approved a final rule adopting section 203  merger filing requirements  generally as proposed  and extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non  spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time that the new york market can be  determined to be  workably competitive   at the same time  ferc ordered a  technical conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market  and  urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution  next  steps  and deadlines for resolution  implementation  additional details are  provided below   ferc updates  streamlines merger filing process  ferc unanimously approved its proposed order revising the reporting  requirements for mergers  however  comm  hebert did so with reservations  as  discussed below  commission staff stated that the order closely follows the  notice of proposed rulemaking previously issued  but adds more detail and  more certainty to the industry  staff stated that the order is improved over  the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain  entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products   according to ferc  the draft order    revises the commission  s filing requirements to reflect existing merger  policy based on ferc  s 1996 merger policy guidelines    provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market  analyses  the rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with  potential horizontal competitive concerns  in addition  the rule establishes  informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses    streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise  competitive concerns  and   reduces the industry  s regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing  requirements   the rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the federal  register   commissioner reaction   comm  hebert expressed reservations that  although he was voting for the  rule  ferc should not be duplicating the department of justice  doj  and the  federal trade commission  ftc  market concentration analyses and that ferc  should follow the lead of anti  trust enforcement officials  who could also  analyze mergers faster and more confidentially  he also stated that ferc  should review the filings after the doj or the ftc review them  not before   and that there should be a definite time frame for review  hebert did  mention that he was pleased that rtos and the disposition of transmission  assets would be exempt  that ancillary services would be considered as a  separate product and that the final rule opens the door for alternative  market analysis   comm  breathitt supported the final rule  stating that it should expedite the  approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the  fact that older  irrelevant requirements have been dropped  she indicated  that the final rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting  the public interest by stating that the process will be  efficient yet  sufficient   the commissioner said that she was pleased the final rule  addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail  competition and one of her main concerns  confidentiality   comm  massey fully supported the final rule  emphasizing that it would  improve response time  lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the  industry to better predict commission actions  like commissioner breathitt   massey was pleased that the order will allow market modeling analysis that  will better enable ferc to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants  to point to other factors when concentration appears too high  massey also  stated that the new rule includes the ability to address many of ferc  s  concerns  such as future mergers when they occur in succession  retail  competition  mitigation by the enlargement of markets through rtos and  analysis of ancillary services  in sum  he averred that the order will  provide ferc with the tools it needs for accurate analysis  while taking into  consideration the rapid changes in the industry   chairman hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was  a very important rule  in response to comm  hebert  chairman hoecker said  that the doj and ftc actually wait for ferc  s report before issuing their  own  that the anti  trust enforcement agencies rely on ferc  s expertise when  reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries  there is a major  positive connection between industry consolidation and rtos and that both are  reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work  he noted  because the  rtos enlarge the size of the subject market  he indicated  rtos will help to  preserve competition  therefore  more and larger rtos should allow for more  mergers  he said  the chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that  joining an rto is a requirement for a merger  but that it would certainly be  viewed favorably   nyiso bid caps extended until ancillary service market shown to be workably  competitive  in a 3  1 decision  with comm  hebert dissenting  ferc extended the existing  nyiso bid cap in its non  spinning reserves market and the related mandatory  bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be   workably competitive   at the same time  ferc ordered a technical  conference to explore changes to the nyiso reserves market  and urged market  participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution  next steps  and  deadlines for resolution  implementation   in so doing  ferc rejected certain aspects of nyiso  s september 1 and 8  2000  compliance filing  submitted pursuant to its may 31  2000 order imposing a  temporary bid cap through october 31  the iso  s efforts to correct market  flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had  not yet satisfied the commission  s directives  ferc concluded  ferc found  that while nyiso has achieved solid progress in certain areas  overall the  iso has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then  gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the iso  s non  spinning reserve  market by april 2001  as the iso requested   commissioner reaction   comms  hoecker  massey and breathitt all endorsed the order as an  imperfect  solution   yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the  iso  s market  comm  hebert faulted the commission for squandering an  opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls   hoecker and breathitt joined hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack  of the iso  s progress  but contended that significant outstanding issues must  be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted   in other action  ferc accepted nyiso  s and nepool  s proposed

speech is a license to speak directly at  and be in the  mf physical presence of any particular individual of your  choosing  especially  mf when that individual is busy doing something else and isnt  interested  bs yep i agree 100    sure  and that goes back to my second argument  cohen   they can  walk away   nobody compells them to stand there ill agree fully  but we still have a constitutional right to speak out against  policies actions and grievances   again  if you want it another way lets change the constitution  bs huh  are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard bs shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship if bs shouting down public speakers is protected it is only a matter of time bs before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against bs them every single time they open their mouth the tactic is stupid and bs nonproductive and if generally used will only result in chaos  the tactic bs is just stupid egobation at best unless the goal is to generate chaos bs and humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society bs should be locked up provided you can accurately identify them which is not bs really possible anyway but hey this is my rant  imho  bs bill   no offense or anything but theres a difference between holding a sign that doesnt agree with bush and screaming at him  my sole point as far as the 1st amendment goes is that there is more to this game than just being an angry liberal youth  which is the gross culmination of everyones argument sofar  the screaming isnt the most effective method around  i dont believe i argued that it was  but screaming is happening because the means to communicate to the representatives involved are diminishing at least as far as the people doing the screaming are concerned   for the record i dont support the screamers in organized conferences such as the colin powell shoutdown that was mentioned earlier  i dont think that this is what the 1st amendment was implying  these folks do have a right to be heard and i think they have a right to be heard by the folks they elected in the first place  my point my only point was really more concerned with the cases such as mr nell   he wasnt engaged at least from the limited facts we have in a shoutout but rather in a difference of opinion   he has a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the representatives that are elected   a sign is not a shoutout  i think i may have missed or not accurately addressed the original thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming dissenters to the mix  i was mostly responding with my miffedness in having broadbrush strokes applied to a group without examining the policy reasons that might have contributed to it   in this case the screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from the folks they need to speak with   theyre resorting to creative offensive and constitutionally challengable means but its not simply due to the fact that theyre 20 and have lost all decorum   the my generation never did this  is all bs   theres more to this story we just dont know it all  i hope this clarifies my position   for the quick rehash  screaming  free speech on all cases dissent  free speech provided you follow what has been laid down by the supremes  k    best regards

subject erisk interview  vince   you may inteersted in the following interview which appeared on erisk  com last friday  were rick buy  s comments about real options taken out of context   yann bonduelle leads a 25  person team for in london  that applies decision analytics and real options theory to dilemmas ranging from  valuing a biotechnology product to deciding whether to kill off an internet financial  services business  here he talks to rob jameson about whether this  theoretical   approach to risky decision  making really helps businesses in their day  to  day  balancing of risk and reward  yann holds a ph  d degree from the  engineering  economic systems department at stanford university  where he  studied how to apply engineering decision and design analysis to wider economic   social and business issues  he then worked as a consultant applying his decision  analysis methodologies to problems that included consumer decision making  about innovative products such as electrical vehicles  before joining the   team in 1998 where he is now a partner  he has  written widely on the application of real options  particularly in fields of life  sciences  technology  and e  business  and has a special interest in the  relationship between risk assessment  validation of risk data and financial  valuation   how would you sum up your approach to business decision analytics   most of our projects are set up to help businesses that face massive uncertainties  of some kind  decision analysis helps people explore problems  and redesign  their decision  making process to increase the chance of them making the right  choices  for example  imagine a biotechnology company that has to decide  whether to put itself up for sale  enter a strategic relationship  or continue to go it  alone  each of those options will lead on to other value  enhancing or  value  destroying scenarios  we work with the client firstly to understand and  challenge the assumptions associated with their most likely business  development scenarios  and secondly to help them identify decisions that would  help protect or increase the value of their technology or company  quantifying  technical  regulatory or commercial risks can sometimes be a challenge  in  technology  intensive fields  however  we have found that managers  often  scientists  are quite willing to describe the main sources of risk and to assess the  probability that a risky event may or may not occur   how does this kind of risky decision  making relate to real options valuation   you can  t say what the value of an asset is until you decide what you might use it  for  this means that  to form an opinion about the value of an asset  you must  explore the most important decisions that you are likely to face and that will have  a significant impact on the value of the asset  so decision analysis helps to define  the business problem and to uncover a stream of inter  related choices that are  in  effect   real options   for example  if a company is trying to decide whether to  invest in a risky project  does it have the option to pull the plug on the investment  at an early stage if a pilot project gives a poor showing  that  real  option reduces  the riskiness  and increases the potential value  of the original business plan  so  real options and decision analysis are really very close to one another  but you  don  t have to believe in real options valuations to find decision analysis useful   what do you mean   often decision analysis can help managers to identify the key risks in a strategic  decision  attach weights to these  and show clearly how they interact  for many  companies this  risk discovery  is the most valuable part of the exercise   real options theory has been criticised recently for being  well  not very realistic   is it a practical approach to valuation   it  s important not to hold out unrealistic hopes for the real options approach to  valuation  but it  s an exciting methodology  and it  s also sometimes the only  reasonable way of tackling a very practical problem  for example  when a firm  sells an asset  the firm might have to make an independent valuation of the asset  for legal or corporate governance reasons  but in many businesses today there  are assets that simply cannot be valued in traditional ways because they are  difficult to link to cashflows  the cashflows might not exist because the business  is so novel  or they might be hidden  in some respects  a real options analysis is  much closer to reality than a traditional valuation   how  exactly   the classic way of valuing a future business is to base the calculation on a single  discounted cashflow that is projected from the activity  but this doesn  t really take  account of the way that scenarios can change  or the fact that managers can  react to situations as they unfold  i mentioned earlier the option to kill a project or  business at an early point  but the upside is that if a pilot project yields exciting  results  it might allow you to invest more quickly and reach a revenue  generating  position in a much shorter time than the original business plan allows  so to value  a future business we really need to look at the cashflows that might arise in a  number of scenarios  this is  realistic  in that  if the project gets the green light   you can bet that its managers will be taking that kind of decision on the ground all  of the time   what  s the most challenging part of mapping out a decision analysis tree   modelling the links between the variables in the decision tree   it  s something we  have particular strengths in  but it  s also tricky to know when it  s worthwhile to  add on more detail  and when it  s better to draw back   in a recent erisk interview  rick buy  chief risk officer of enron  said that over  the two years that enron had experimented with the real options concept  it had  found it of  limited  but not zero  use   why is there a slight air of cynicism about  real options in some businesses today   it  s strange that enron would profess this attitude  a few years ago  it was widely  reported to have used real option valuation to support a very profitable purchase  decision  they had apparently bought cheaply some older generators in the us  that generated electricity at a very high cost  they knew that they could mothball  them for most of the year  and switch them on only when the electricity prices  were sufficiently high  nevertheless  from a customer  s point of view  there might  have been too much hype about the methodology  one problem in the application  of real options technology is that there are  perhaps  too many people trying to  tweak reality to conform to their  perfect  model  it  s better to aim for something  pragmatic that clearly improves decisions over time  in one pharmaceutical  company we worked with recently  we worked together to improve their valuation  analyses by moving from a single discounted cash  flow methodology to one that  took into account a rather small set of business scenarios  it would have shocked  some academics and consultants  but it was an undeniable improvement on the  original approach   why do you think financial institutions are only just picking up on your field  when  it  s been applied in the energy industry for 15 years or more   it might have something to do with the relative stability of the banking world until  recently  and the relatively high margins that banking lines have enjoyed  also   industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals tend to have more people with an  engineering and science background  the dynamic modelling of decisions is  based on methodologies originally dreamed up to help engineers design electrical  and electronic systems  this approach is quite distinct from the black  scholes  options analyses that the banking world is familiar with  the black  scholes  approach is difficult to apply in a real options context  because everything  depends on the assumptions that you put into the black  scholes model  the real  options approach  on the other hand  is in a sense a way of modelling those  assumptions more explicitly  but banks are now adopting some of the thinking   particularly in terms of using decision analysis to pinpoint risks and identify  value  enhancing decisions  and in using real options methodologies to sort the  wheat from the chaff in their more speculative investments   you mean their internet investments   we have recently worked with a major dutch bank that had arrived late in the  internet game  and then made a considerable number of investments  now that  even b 2 b business models have questions marks hanging over them  and many  b 2 c businesses are already under water  they wanted to work out which  investments might contain real value  in this situation  it  s a case of ranking  priorities and helping the bank make sense of what could turn into a  decision  making chaos  rather than sophisticated valuation  it  s not just a case of  whether an internet investment should be killed off  but the problem of whether  continued funding for it should take priority over budget demands for major it  upgrades in existing businesses  and so on  these are very practical questions  and they have to be answered somehow   are there other areas in financial institutions that seem accessible to this  approach   yes  for example  we think it can help work out the value associated with various  approaches to marketing a new bank business line  at the moment  many banks  are chasing high  net  worth individuals  but it  s not always clear which kind of  individual a particular bank should decide to pursue  the bank might have a  regional or industry advantage already in one particular area  for example  music  business people  but what is the churn rate associated with this kind of  customer  what is the profitability associated with the customer segment  will  the time and cost benefits of the advantages the bank has in the sector outweigh  any disadvantages  weighing up this kind of complex problem  where one thing  leads to and depends on another  is what decision and real options analysis is  good at   is there any way of rigorously backtesting or validating real options valuations   in all honesty  not really  the problem is that by the time the option is exercised   many of the variables surrounding it will have changed  so it  s difficult to compare  our original analysis with how things turn out  however  the value of the analysis  comes not only from the final number   the value of this asset is x   but also from  providing a thorough process  an outsider  s point of view  an understanding of the  sources of value and  in short  a bit of clearer thinking   if real options are so important  why are they so rarely cited in communications to  shareholders and equity analysts   the battle is still to convince companies to use real option valuations as a  significant part of their internal analysis  even in major companies in the oil  gas   and pharmaceutical sectors  where the ideas have taken some root internally   there seems to be a lot of reluctance to use them in external communication  we  are working with analysts to understand better what they need to if we are to move  things on to the next step   how does the riskiness of a business  in terms of the major strategic dilemmas it  faces  relate to its share value  and its capital structure   that  s a big question  it  s related to work my colleagues do on the optimal  debt  to  equity capital structure and gearing of a corporation  which in turn arises  out of the likely revenue and cost volatilities of the business  the more volatile the  business  the less gearing it can sustain  and the higher the cost of capital  our  work touches on this in the sense that exercising  many  specific real options can  allow a firm to change its nature  and thus also its risk profile  one classic  example is the pharmaceutical industry  a host of different kinds of companies  service that industry from  big pharma  companies through to smaller  biotechnology startups and run  of  the  mill contract research organisations  a  contract research organisation is often operating within a very competitive  environment with relatively few risks   it does not invest in drug development itself    but also very thin margins  but in fact  a few of these companies have used the  skills and knowledge they have developed to become much more substantial and  profitable healthcare companies of various kinds  it  s an example of a company  exercising the real options that lie within its skills and assets to transform its own  identity   rob jameson  erisk,ham,ham

httpwwwwashingtonpostcomac2wpdynpagenamearticlenodecontentida581732002mar7notfoundtrue  slaughter in the name of god by salman rushdie friday march 8 2002 page a33 washington post  the defining image of the week for me is of a small childs burned and  blackened arm its tiny fingers curled into a fist protruding from the  remains of a human bonfire in ahmadabad gujarat in india the murder  of children is something of an indian specialty the routine daily  killings of unwanted girl babies    the massacre of innocents in  nellie assam in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring  village    the massacre of sikh children in delhi during the  horrifying reprisal murders that followed indira gandhis assassination  they bear witness to our particular gift always most dazzlingly in  evidence at times of religious unrest for dousing our children in  kerosene and setting them alight or cutting their throats or  smothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length  of wood  i say our because i write as an indian man born and bred who loves  india deeply and knows that what one of us does today any of us is  potentially capable of doing tomorrow if i take pride in indias  strengths then indias sins must be mine as well do i sound angry  good ashamed and disgusted i certainly hope so because as india  undergoes its worst bout of hindumuslim bloodletting in more than a  decade many people have not been sounding anything like angry ashamed  or disgusted enough police chiefs have been excusing their mens  unwillingness to defend the citizens of india without regard to  religion by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to  the same sentiments as the nation in general  meanwhile indias political masters have been tuttutting and offering  the usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control  it has escaped nobodys notice that the ruling party the bharatiya  janata party bjp or indian peoples party and the hindu extremists  of the vishwa hindu parishad vhp or world hindu council are sister  organizations and offshoots of the same parent body even some  international commentators such as britains independent newspaper  urge us to beware excess pessimism  the horrible truth about communal slaughter in india is that were used  to it it happens every so often then it dies down thats how life is  folks most of the time india is the worlds largest secular democracy  and if once in a while it lets off a little crazy religious steam we  mustnt let that distort the picture  of course there are political explanations ever since december 1992  when a vhp mob demolished a 400yearold muslim mosque in ayodhya which  they claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god ram hindu  fanatics have been looking for this fight the pity of it is that some  muslims were ready to give it to them their murderous attack on the  trainload of vhp activists at godhra with its awful atavistic echoes  of the killings of hindus and muslims by the trainload during the  partition riots of 1947 played right into the hindu extremists hands  the vhp has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and  insufficient radicalism of indias bjp government prime minister atal  bihari vajpayee is more moderate than his party he also heads a  coalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the bjps  more extreme hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together  but it isnt working anymore in state elections across the country the  bjp is being trounced this may have been the last straw for the vhp  firebrands why put up with the governments betrayal of their fascistic  agenda when that betrayal doesnt even result in electoral success  the electoral failure of the bjp is thus in all probability the spark  that lit the fire the vhp is determined to build a hindu temple on the  site of the demolished ayodhya mosque  thats where the godhra dead  were coming from  and there are reprehensibly idiotically  tragically muslims in india equally determined to resist them vajpayee  has insisted that the slow indian courts must decide the rights and  wrongs of the ayodhya issue the vhp is no longer prepared to wait  the distinguished indian writer mahasveta devi in a letter to indias  president k r narayanan blames the gujarat government led by a bjp  hardliner as well as the central government for doing too little too  late she pins the blame firmly on the motivated wellplanned out and  provocative actions of the hindu nationalists but another writer the  nobel laureate v s naipaul speaking in india just a week before the  violence erupted denounced indias muslims en masse and praised the  nationalist movement  the murderers of godhra must indeed be denounced and mahasveta devi in  her letter demands stern legal action against them but the vhp is  determined to destroy that secular democracy in which india takes such  public pride and which it does so little to protect and by supporting  them naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces  the nobel award  the political discourse matters and explains a good deal but theres  something beneath it something we dont want to look in the face  namely that in india as elsewhere in our darkening world religion is  the poison in the blood where religion intervenes mere innocence is no  excuse yet we go on skating around this issue speaking of religion in  the fashionable language of respect what is there to respect in any  of this or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around  the world in religions dreaded name how well with what fatal results  religion erects totems and how willing we are to kill for them and  when weve done it often enough the deadening of affect that results  makes it easier to do it again  so indias problem turns out to be the worlds problem what happened in  india has happened in gods name the problems name is

the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to the help that i received today  then though i tried to build them  i started by trying the w3 program  i used the following lines which produced some strange results  would any one be able to set me straight  configure withemacs prefixusrlocalsrcbetaw3 execprefixusr localsrcbetaw3 withurlurlurl that worked fine so i moved to the next step make at the bottem of the text i got the following messages cannot open load file urlurlurlvarsel make1  customloadel error 255 make1 leaving directory usrlocalsrcbetaw3lisp make  w3 error 2  when i got around to trying the url package i had no problems  in saying that this doesnt necessarily mean that i was doing it right so below are the commands i used configure withemacs prefixurlurl execprefixurlurl followed by the commands make and make install there is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so im not completely certain if ive used the right method here

subject california 1  17  01  summary   late night efforts by the california assembly to craft a legislative solution  are falling short of market and creditor expectations  bankruptcy appears  increasingly likely  but the dynamics of a ch  11 proceeding remain unclear   socal edison is likely to be the first in ch  11 following its suspended  payments to creditors yesterday and is now in a 30 day cure period  attempts  to bring in the assets of the parent companies are unlikely to succeed   bankruptcy would provide davis with some political cover to implement the  tough decisions that he has so far avoided on the questions of rate hikes and  other costs to taxpayers connected to the proposed operations of the  california power authority   1  legislation passes assembly  but generators and consumers remain unhappy  the first legislation  ab lx  passed the california general assembly last  night  but both generators and consumers are unhappy with the terms   generators object to the 5  5 cent per kw  h price in the proposed long  term  contract  while consumer groups such as the foundation for taxpayer and  consumer rights object to the state acting as a purchaser of power  the  legislation is expected to pass the senate today and to be signed by governor  davis as early as tonight   press and source reporting this morning confirms that the principal financial  creditors and utility analysts are also unimpressed with the bill  which is  viewed as insubstantial and falling short of creating a solution to the  financial pressures on the utilities   2  financial institutions exposure to california utilities  bank of america   215 million  j  p  morgan   202 million  there is a total of  12 billion in outstanding loans  but much of this   arranged by societe general  is to the parents national energy group and  edison international  the  417 million mentioned above is the most immediate  concern  the southern california edison loans are subject to immediate  repayment in the aftermath of yesterday  s rating downgrade to junk status   the fed will not be involved  except in a routine way as a bank regulator  making sure that the appropriate risk reserves are made against the  utilities  loans and securities  there is no moral hazard here  because the  fed is not going to guarantee any of the utilities  credits  which  by the  way  they do not have the authority to do   3  pg  e  national energy group  shielding assets  despite considerable anger at pg  e for reorganizing to shield its profitable  assets from its debt  plagued utility business  it would seem that davis has  little authority to intervene  the question of  fraudulent conveyance   which  is a term in bankruptcy law for transferring assets to favored parties not  long before a filing  which transfer can then be reversed by the court  would  not seem to apply here  since pg dynegy has threaten to take take edison into  bankruptcy court if they default  pg  e  current available   500 m in cash and reserves  due feb  lst   580 m to iso  15 th   431 m to california power exchange  contrary to press reports and leaks from the governor  s office yesterday  about political brinksmanship  edison is clearly not playing negotiating  games and is really short of cash  in this situation  it is unlikely that its  executives will be making fraudulent statements  the bonds on which they  failed to pay would have a 30  day cure period  after that the trustees will  move on edison  if edison has not already filed  they have three ways of  financing power purchases going forward  1  the state continues to buy power  and sell edison  and pg or 2  pending the passage of today  s legislation  the state  legislature authorizes the purchase of power through long  term contracts  under the proposed borrowing authority  or 3  edison files for reorganization  under chapter 11 and obtains almost immediately superpriority post  petition  lines of credit secured against its unmortgaged assets  which it uses to pay  for power until the puc and the rest of the state government recognize that  rates have to increase   6  new hampshire experience a guide for davis   following the bankruptcy of the public service company of new hampshire  the  bankruptcy judge was authorized by a higher court to mandate rate hikes  the  prospect of imposed rate hikes from the bankruptcy court caused the state  government to subsequently determine that rate hikes to consumers were  unavoidable  passing a seven year rate hike of 7  5 percent   for davis  a similar scenario would provide him with some political cover  if  he were forced by the bankruptcy court to pass through rate hikes as part of  a settlement ,ham,ham

apple  user groups was re augd re pr mailing liststhis discussion has drifted far far away from initial subject of pr    mailing lists so it about time we changed subject and yes i probably    should have done it last time i replied to this thread    on 28042010 at 339 am chris hart wrote    john feltham at  wrote      gday chris     on 21042010 at 102 pm chris hart wrote     see thats downright disgusting that apple wont even acknowledge   our existence     while i agree that their position is not good i think that you     have to think   that their business is the manufacture and sale of their products     im not asking them to promote our groups prominently  i just want     them to   publicly acknowledge our existence in a proud fashion and not     hesitate to   mention us to their customers when appropriate    when is an appropriate time    and how do apple decide which user groups to acknowledge in a proud    fashion  there are groups out there that only have a dozen or so members    others seem to a large portion of members still using powerpc based    machines and from my experience it seems very few traditional user    groups actually cater for the demographic that apple is now chasing        years ago the local store did allow us to meet there twice      once in the   first year of their existence once in the second  the attitude     towards us   during the second visit was not as good as the first  despite the     fact that   our group was the ideal audience and perfectly behaved during both     visits   not that thats ever an issue with our group but i wanted to make     it clear   that i saw no reason for the attitude     what makes your group an ideal audience  im suggesting that you arent in fact i am curious to see how all    user groups feel about this point  are user groups in fact the ideal audience for apple or would apple    just be preaching to the converted     finding a place to hold your meetings is just a function of that     task they   are your meetings no one elses     the store had indicated that they would provide the   programpresentationpresenter  are we supposed to come up with a     backup   presentation and presenter for every meeting we plan in case the     meeting   falls through  not really gonna happen and i doubt any user groups     do that   except for occasions where they have reason to believe an outoftown   presenters appearance could fall through    over at my own website i recently highlighted a series of posts from    oreilly on how to deal with speaker cancelations  httpwwwappleusersorgshareoreillysharehowtodealwithspeakercancelations    every group i have ever known has had to deal with this one time or    another ive been in the situation where ive had to find a last    minute replacement or usually be the last minute replacement yes it    is embarrassing but these things do unfortunately happen    ive even been known to be the cause of such cancelations to groups    myself   often im booked months in advance to present to a group then    circumstances change and i have to cancel  other times ive had initial discussions about presenting again    months in advance and then i hear nothing until the night before the    presentation asking if am i still ok with tomorrow    q is all i can say    there are plenty of ways of gently reminding a presenter that they    have a presentation coming up soon and harking back to the original    topic of this thread a forwarding of a press release youve sent    out a month before the meeting that mentions the forthcoming meeting    next month is one simple way of doing so it also shows that you care    enough about the topicpresenter to promote it       that really annoyed we board members because we were made to look     like   idiots and our general membership was highly disappointed  we     swore that we   would never do anything involving that store ever again      so far everything that you have written about has ha a negative     approach   slant     everything about the situation was negative  i dont see any point in   putting a smiley face on it     the only positive that came about was for the board to swear we will     never   rely on that store again  we now have the freedom of not relying on     such   careless individuals for the focus of one of our meetings    how much communication did you have with the store leading up to the    presentation  surely you werent discussing things even the week before the meeting    and they still just let you turn up    i know of instances where user groups have made plans with apple    retail stores      with regard to user groups there is no excuse  everything     about our   groups   is centered around furthering the usefulness of apple products  we     provide   a positive familyfriendly intelligent resource to mac users      how is that   not something to let the world know about      i agree but then i say get out and bang the drum do we really     need apple     yes we really do     increasingly the average owneruser of apple products thinks that     the local   apple store is the one and only place for to further the apple     experience    in many cases it is the best place for many people  i hate to say it but i cringe at some of the comments i see on user    group mailing lists etc about what a product may or may not do and how    wrong those responses are  an example ive seen twice on different lists in recent weeks is the    point about ipads and if they are locked to att for starters    both people inquiring were talking about ipads with wifi only  so    automatically there is no need to even mention been locked in to    att  secondly both groups were located in australia and whilst one    was talking about importing an ipad from the us the other was asking    if they could use it in the uk when they visited family there later in    the year  steve jobs made it abundantly clear in his keynote speech launching    the ipad that it was not locked to any carrier yet on both mug    lists people responded saying the ipad was likely to be locked in to    att and so the people inquiring would not be able to use the ipad as    they had hoped which was just plain wrong    now i not saying that user groups always get it wrong more often    then not they dont and they do actually provide an independent    viewpoint for example the discussion on this very list about how    best to demo an ipad was very enlightening and provided far more    information on the topic then i got out of my contacts at apple    australian and apple us on how do do the same thing when the iphone    first came out here about 18 months after the us go it  so it wasnt    exactly the latest news then and im sure others had similar queries    at  the time     the message of user groups is lost in the scale of the apple media     presence    then it is up to user groups to address that themselves which    again harks back to the original topic of this thread    here in australia we have taken steps towards addressing this i    produced a full page flyer promoting active apple user groups here    see page 15 of the febmar issue of the appleusers spotlight a 30    page digital format magazine i publish here in australia for an    example of the ad  httpwwwappleusersorgmagazinefebruary2010issueofappleusersspotlightnowavailable    the electronic copy of the flyer has each user group name as an    active hyperlink so people can jump straight to a group in their state  if it appeared in a printed magazine or flyer then there is still the    simple url that can easily be typed in which lands you at a page with    links to the various groups own webpages    the primary url used on the flyer was actually put to a vote and    everyone agreed that we wouldnt use the wwwapplecomauusergroup    link or even the wwwapplecomauusergroup one as quite a few of    the active groups here have chosen not to be listed there  so they    can be seen as been independent from apple and any other retailer    and also due to the fact that listing often falls out of date      i just realised that the ad needs updating  we dont mention the ipad    in the current version     we also have a portrait version on hand if we need it in fact the    flyer started out as an a4 size portrait flyer when we were approached    to have an ad in one of australian macworlds super guide publications     unfortunately we couldnt arrange enough funding to go ahead with    the idea in the time frame at hand but now we have a solid basis to    work from the next time an opportunity presents itself    there is nothing stopping a group of user groups in a state    region or area from getting together and producing their own    version of such an ad    i also love what mac users uk have done with their google map showing    the location of each user group in the uk and ireland  httpwwwmacusersukorgmugsmugsmapphp  i really must work out how    to create such a map for australian user groups        let me make an analogy  at music fairs like lollapalooza and     lilith fair   there are secondary stages where lots of great musicians and groups     get   major exposure  theyre not getting the limelight but they sure     get in   front of lots of people they wouldnt otherwise     not only do we not get secondary stage placement but we cant even     hang out   at the gate to the event and have a banner or people handing out     flyers   about our groups    actually most concerts and major events organisers discourage    hawkers from hassling people at the gatesentrance but theyll    quite happily take your groups money and let you have a concession    stand near by and usually take a percentage of your gross takings as    well    and why should apple be expected do the marketing for independent user    groups  yes i know user groups promote apple products but we have chosen    to do so we arent compelled to do so  we come together in user groups or even in online communities such as    this to meet with like minded people and discuss things about a    common topic of interest to us just like there are groups that get    together as book clubs or reptile keepers even gunzels get    together through their common interest in trains real ones and model    ones  no one makes them form these groups nor force people to    participate and most other hobbies arent so unfortunate to    have a central business or entity to focus around yet they survive    and even flourish all by themselves     chris        nicholas pyers nicholasappleusersorg  founder  publisher appleusersorg    httpwwwappleusersorg               do not post admin

subject linux   hit or miss   network world fusion focus  phil hochmuth  on linux  today  s focus  will linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop   03  15  00  dear wincenty kaminski   today  s focus  will linux be a hit or miss  on the corporate desktop   by phil hochmuth  so far this year  the buzz about linux in enterprise networks has  focused on servers and embedded systems  with the growth of linux  severs being most heralded  according to idc  a research firm based in  framingham  mass   linux was the fastest  growing server operating  system last year  with a 93  growth rate over the year before  linux  was the second most  shipped operating system in 1999 after windows nt   capturing 24  of new licenses shipped   as for the embedded market  linux has emerged as an ideal platform for  network appliances  because the system can be modified to handle  specialized  dedicated tasks very well  companies such as cobalt  networks  picazo and progressive systems have announced linux  based  appliances  ranging from web servers to pbxs to firewalls   but what of the open source hacker   s dream of   linux on every desktop   8  sure  linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever  with  colorful  shrink  wrapped boxes of caldera  red hat and corel linux now  available at places like compusa  however  analysts have said that  linux   s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro  areas of network servers and embedded operating systems   according to idc  linux currently runs on only 4  of u  s  desktops  the  hold microsoft windows has on the desktop market will remain strong   analysts say  despite such factors as microsoft   s antitrust problems  and the surging popularity of linux   even some linux executives are skeptical of their product   s desktop  future  recently  suse ceo roland dyroff downplayed linux   s future on  desktops  dyroff said    given the lack of applications available  we  really can  t claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet   8  a recent survey by survey  com gives more hope for linux desktops   according to the survey of 1  640 enterprise network managers  open  source operating systems are used on 10  of desktops  with the number  jumping to a surprising 23  of enterprise desktops by 2002   despite the mix of numbers being thrown around  two important factors  that will determine the success of linux as an enterprise client  desktop are  a standardized  easy  to  use graphical user interface  gui   and available applications   one company that is working to make linux more user friendly is palo  alto  based eazel  which is designing a next  generation file management  system and user interface to run on top of the linux kernel  according  to eazel   s web site  the company   s goal is to bring linux to the masses  and   do it in a way that appeals to today  s linux users and to mere  mortals   8  the company was founded by a group of former apple executives  and is  allied with the gnome project  which has been doing extensive linux  desktop environment development for several years  eazel is due to have  a product out by the middle of this year  with an intuitive  icon  based  file management environment  eazel is hoping its user interface will be  an improvement over the two current linux guis  gnome and kde  and will  help standardized the look and feel of linux for   regular  8 users  for  enterprise mangers who have already embraced linux on the server side   this development will be worth keeping an eye on   on the applications side  several office productivity suites have been  available for some time  such as sun   s staroffice suite and koffice for  the kde desktop  corel has also ported its office products  such as  wordperfect  over to linux to complement its own distribution of the  operating system  while there have been recent rumors  started by linux  care vice president arthur tyde  that microsoft is working on a port of  ms office to linux  microsoft officials deny this   while linux may never supplant windows as the industry  standard desktop   there should be plenty of opportunity for linux pcs in enterprise nets  in the future   to contact phil hochmuth                             phil hochmuth is a writer and researcher for network world  and a former  systems integrator  you can reach

spambayes deploymentso then guido van rossum  is all like    basic procmail usage goes something like this          0fw        spamassassin p          0        xspamstatus yes       spam       do you feel capable of writing such a tool  it doesnt look too hard  not to beat a dead horse but thats exactly what my spamcan package did  for those just tuning in spamcan is a thingy i wrote before i knew about tim  cos work on this crazy stuff you can download it from  but im not going to work on it anymore  im currently writing a new one based on classifier and timtests bootykicking tokenizer  ill probably have something soon like maybe half an hour and no its not too hard  the hard part is storing the data somewhere  i dont want to use zodb as id like something a person can just drop in with a default python install  so anydbm is looking like my best option  i already have a setup like this using xavier leroys spamoracle which does the same sort of thing  you call it from procmail it adds a new header and then you can filter on that header  really easy  heres how i envision this working  everybody gets four new mailboxes    traineggs   trainspam   trainedeggs   trainedspam  you copy all your spam and eggs into the train boxes as you get it how frequently you do this would be up to you but youd get better results if you did it more often and youd be wise to always copy over anything which was misclassified  then every night the spam fairy swoops down and reads through your folders learning about what sorts of things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam  after shes done she moves your mail into the trained folders  this would work for anybody using imap on a unix box or folks who read their mail right off the server  ive spoken with some fellows at work about exchange and they seem to beleive that exchange exports appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well  advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail client to bind the key s to move to trainspam and h to move to traineggs  eventually if enough people used this sort of thing itd start showing up in mail clients  thats the delete as spam button paul graham was talking about   the hormel company might not think well of using the word ham as the   opposite of spam and theyve been amazingly cool about the use of   their product name for things thus far  so i propose we start calling   nonspam something more innocuous and more monty pythonic such as   eggs  neale ,ham,ham

subject re  prosym license  hi karolina   the last word i got was that grant masson was still coordinating the contract  and would be the person to talk to about getting a copy of the license  i  checked to see if i had an electronic copy somewhere  but couldn  t find  anything  i suspect my copy was paper  and it would have been returned to  grant when i went back to portland general electric  probably didn  t speak  to the situation in london  anyway  because the real interest in london  didn  t arise until after i would have gotten my copy   grant is transitioning to his new job with el paso in london  so if you have  difficulty reaching him  check with vince kaminski  or if vince is  unavailable  shriley crenshaw  shirley may know the person in enron legal or  contracts admin  who worked with grant on the henwood license   of course  eric t  would have a copy  if you run into problems with houston   have eric send you a fax   the license is relatively short as contracts go    hope this helps   michael     karolina potter  lon  ect  enron 10  18  00 07  44 am     michael  two weeks ago i attended hesi client symposium followed by advanced prosym  course in sacramento  during that time i had an opportunity to get to know  several people from both henwood energy services support and development  groups  one of them was eric toolson  head of client support in hesi  with  whom i discussed some issues in regards to our liaison with london based  support team  i agreed to meet up with simon crisp back in london to agree  on a form of our working relationship   before i go to the meeting i would like to find out the following   the text of enron  s prosym license  what service we are entitled to based on the license  i am not sure if you are the person to ask about the above but if you could  help me by either providing the license or directing to the appropriate  person within enron it would be much appreciated   many thanks  karolina,ham,ham

different ways of creating a usbinstall stickfrom nobody sun sep 18 204531 2016 contenttype textplain charsetiso88591  hello    im curious as to the different ways one can create a usb install stick for  the purpose of installing debian    it is possible to do it by  a acquiring where a bootimggz file and then doing zcat bootimggz   devsdc then load a netboot iso to the disc  b making a fatfat32 partition on the stick and then doing syslinux  devsdxx copying vmlinuz and initrdgz to the stick  c using unetbootin with an iso file    i like the way unetbootin allows one to use a larger iso dvd or full cd  iso the downside of a and b is that you can only use the smaller netboot  isos and if i wanted to load a few more files onto the disc for use i  wouldnt have the room to do so    does anyone know another method im particularly interested in knowing the  way to do what unetbootin does manually so that i could load a cddvd iso  onto the stick after making it bootable    regards  james  ,ham,ham
pluck and luckanyone who doesnt appreciate both pluck and luck is only looking at part of the equation  america has in fact moved hard toward meritocracy  but  and this is a huge one  you dont necessarily find it on the forbes list  there is an element of luck even if only being in the right place at the right time to go that high  beyond the forbes list there are many ways in which almost pure luck is involved in significant wealth  being a supermodel for example though i think most people would be surprised by a lot of supermodels cindy crawford was valedictorian of her high school  most people of course arent in those stratified realms  it is the rest of us who tend to sort  there is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of merit in the first place  rawls claims merit doesnt exist  sowell seems to agree at least in part but im sure sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous  and if merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring  iq  purity of heart  or the ability to satisfy customers  functionally most people seem to equate merit with iq though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart  yet the type of merit that lands you on the forbes list or even just being a garden variety millionaire next door is more likely to be the serving customers definition  differences due to merit when they are perceived as such generate far more animosity than differences due to luck  luck can be forgiven superior performance often not    original message  from forkadminxentcom

have ivy league educations or are ivy league   dropouts suggesting to me that they werent exactly poor to start   with    actually if i remember correctly from discussion of the lists  composition in forbes about five or six years ago the best way to  get on the forbes 400 is to have no college at all can you say  bootstraps boys and girls i knew you could    given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school  like say mine  is nothing but stuff they should have taught  you in a governmentrun high school youll probably get more of  those on the forbes 400 as well as time goes on if we ever get  around to having a good old fashioned governmentcollapsing  transferpayment depression an economic version of this summers  governmentforest conflagration caused by the same kind of  innumeracy that not clearcutting enough forests did out west this  summer  that should motivate more than a few erstslackers out  there including me  to learn to actually feed themselves      the next category on the forbes 400 list is someone with a  terminal professional degree like an mba phd md etc from the  best school possible    why because as of about 1950 the best way to get into harvard  for instance is to be smart not rich dont take my word for it  ask their admissions office look at the admissions stats over the  years for proof    meritocracy american style was invented at the ivy league after  world war ii even stanford got the hint  and of course  chicago taught them all how right  practically nobody who  goes to a top20 american institution of higher learning can actually  afford to go there these days unless of course their parents who  couldnt afford to go there themselves got terminal degrees in the  last 40 years or so and their kids still had to get the grades  and biased by intelligence  test scores to get in      the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with terminal  degrees until they actually own something and hire people or  learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss  basis persist in the practically insane belief like life after  death that economics is some kind of zero sum game that dumb people  who dont work hard for it make all the money and if someone is  smart works hard and is rich then they stole their wealth somehow    btw none of you guys out there holding the short end of this  rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that im using it to  beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders you  were apparently too dumb to grab the right end i went to  missouri and i dont have a degree in anything actually useful  much less a terminal one which means im broker than anyone on  this list  its just that you of all people lots with  educations far surpassing my own should just plain know better the  facts speak for themselves if you just open your eyes and look  there are no epicycles the universe does not orbit the earth and  economics is not a zerosum game the cost of anything including  ignorance and destitution is the forgone alternative in this case  intelligence and effort    i will however admit to being educated waay past my level of  competence and by the way you discuss economics so have you  apparently        btw if we ever actually had free markets in this country  including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes  all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have more money and  there would be more selfmade people on that list in addition  most of the people who inherited money on the list would have  much less of it not even relatively speaking finally practically  all of that new money would have come from economic efficiency and  not stolen from someone else investment bubbles or not    that efficiency is called progress for those of you in the  peoples republics of berkeley or cambridge it means more and better  stuff cheaper over time  a terrible petitbourgeois concept  apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite or youd  know about it by now in economic terms its also called an increase  in general welfare and no virginia im not talking about  extorting money from someone who works and giving it to someone who  doesnt in order to keep them from working and they can think of some  politician as santa claus come election time      in short then economics is not a zero sum game property is not  theft the rich dont get rich off the backs of the poor and  redistributionist labor theory of value happy horseshit is just  that horseshit happy or otherwise    to believe otherwise is  quite literally given the time marx  wrote capital and the manifesto  romantic nonsense    cheers  rah    begin pgp signature  version pgp 75

re satalk ot habeus  whydan kohn  writes   guys the habeas infringers list hil exists explicitly to deal with  spammers while were getting judgments against them and especially in  other countries where those judgments are harder to get  my concern doesnt stem from failing to understand how your business is intended to work  my concern is the lack of empirical evidence that it will reduce the amount of uncaught spam   please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after  regular spammers  yes some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant  pyramid schemes and isps have won some theft of service suits but  the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles  so i cant understand how daniel can assert that you cant track  spammers down when its never really been tried  please dont misquote me  i did not assert that you cant track spammers  here is what i said   it will be difficult to find prosecute and win money from someone in  various nonfriendly countries where spam originates china is a good  example even if they do officially respect copyright law  i understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers but that does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox  it is an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient to counteract the ease with which a 20 score on the mark allows spam to avoid being tagged as spam   daniel its easy enough for you to change the habeas scores yourself  on your installation  if habeas fails to live up to its promise to  only license the warrant mark to nonspammers and to place all  violators on the hil then i have no doubt that justin and craig will  quickly remove us from the next release  but youre trying to kill  habeas before it has a chance to show any promise  i think ive worked on sa enough to understand that i can localize a score  im just not comfortable with using spamassassin as a vehicle for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base  i think it would make more sense to start habeas with a less aggressive score one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyones inbox and after weve seen evidence that the system works then we can increase the magnitude of the score  dan    this sfnet email is sponsored bythinkgeek welcome to geek heaven httpthinkgeekcomsf  spamassassintalk mailing list spamassassintalklistssourceforgenet httpslistssourceforgenetlistslistinfospamassassintalk  ,ham,ham

to stan hanks for some time about enron  s  interests in passive measurement and are in the process of implementing  some of the performance features in coralreef that he has described as  relevant to

transport layer   rating schemes  provider  net performance  pages  internet   weather map  s  keynote  etc   publish as caida web pages  or maybe as an info rfc   survey paper on metrics and internet

taxonomy of current metrics  ippm  rtfm  itu       summary of metrics used for current services   gather information  ideas about new  emerging services   especially diffserv  based ones   make list

metric definitions through ippm or rtfm   produce document  measurement requirements for hardware  software  vendors   publish on caida web pages  appendix a  questions from the earlier draft caida wg charters  a  what types of network  and transport  layer metrics are being  used by isps in engineering and operating their networks   by customers for verifying service guarantees   b  what new services are being  or are likely to be  offered  e  g   diffserv  is there a need for higher  layer metrics to better  monitor and manage these services   c  will these new differentiated transport  and  application  layer services need new metrics   d  how can the service metrics be measured in a multi  isp  environment   e  how can customers verify these measurements   f  what requirements would service measurement introduce for  equipment vendors   g  how relevant are specific techniques  e  g  which flow  and  points of measurement to specific users  isp  customer  etc    requirements   h  how do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived  by users  how do they correlate with performance   appendix b  background on the ietf working groups   rtfm wg  realtime traffic flow measurement  rtfm is concerned with passive measurements of two  way traffic flows   specified in terms of their end  point attributes  its primary goal was  to produce an improved traffic flow measurement model considering at least the  following needs   a  wider range of measurable quantities  e  g  those  relating to ipv 6  and to class of service  b  simpler ways to specify flows of interest  c  better ways to control access to measured flow data  d  strong focus on data reduction capabilities  e  efficient hardware implementation   ippm wg  ip performance measurement  the ippm wg charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can  be applied to the quality  performance  and reliability of internet  data delivery services  these metrics will be designed such that they  can be performed by network operators  end users  or independent  testing groups  it is important that the metrics not represent a value  judgement  i  e  define  good  and  bad    but rather provide unbiased  quantitative measures of performance   rfcs  framework for ip performance metrics  rfc 2330   metrics   connectivity  rfc 2678    one  way delay  rfc 2679   one  way packet loss  rfc 2680   round  trip delay  rfc 2681   i  ds  bulk transfer capacity  2 x   instantaneous packet delay variation  one  way loss patterns   other wgs  the rmonmib wg is thinking about  application performance  measurement   this is clearly a hard problem  e  g  does this just  mean response  time measurement  can it be done by passive means  how  should the measurements be presented  etc     in short   rtfm provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic  volumes   ippm has concentrated on transport  layer behaviour of the  current  best  effort internet    rmonmib is beginning to consider application  layer measurement       end of forwarded message     ,ham,ham

subject data for moody  s riskcalc  craig and kim   as you know  i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody  s  riskcalc   you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc   well  after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through  today  s 2  hour moody  s presentation  it is necessary for us to have  information about enron  s counterparties to move to the next step with  riskcalc   we have obtained some information on enron  s european counterparties from  our colleagues in the london office   we need for you and  or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us  with a list of enron  s north american counterparties   more specifically  to evaluate moody  s riskcalc we will need the following  financial inputs for enron  s north american  private firm  counterparties   fiscal year  the prior twelve months of financial data are represented  annual statements  are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables   such as cost of goods sold  net income  sales  and ebit  the value should be  a four  digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or  2000  forecasts until the year 2009 can be made  a constant rate of inflation  is applied to future years using last year  s  1999  inflation level  in  general this  estimation error  will not cause any great problems  as size  affects

total liabilities   net income  this item represents the income  or loss  reported by a company after  expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the  fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations  a  loss is represented by a negative sign  for example  a  5  000  000 loss would  be entered as  5000  leave previous year  s net income blank for australian  companies   extraordinary items  positive or negative  this item represents unusual items that sometimes  appear on the income statement  the items are designated by the company as  extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and  discontinued operations  these items include extraordinary gains  losses   income  loss  from discontinued operations  and cumulative affect of  accounting changes  expenses are entered as negative values  gains as  positive values  leave previous year  s extraordinary items blank for  australian companies   country

re the mime information you requested last changed 3154 feb 14justin mason writes  has anyone figured out whats up with this  does someone out there  think that fork needs some mime tutoring  i was puzzled at first but i think i understand what happened  first i approved the post because it didnt appear to be spam even though it wasnt from a member  i thought it was odd that someone wanted to send the mime blurb to the list but it was not really that different from causing the new york times web site to send a story to the list  except that the bits here are antediluvian but old bits are a problem to be solved by social opporobrium not technical constraints  but i think what actually happened is that some idiot got infected by klez and had both fork and the pinerobot autoresponder address in their mailbox or addressbook so klez forged mail from forkxentcom to the autoresponder which responded  to fork  ,ham,ham

superior product is undeniable therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence thereby our definition of excellence has evolved this shangrila project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts first on an agricultural level fields for our gnarly sweetgrass  must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken this is how the botanical achieves potent significance much like the regimen of ginseng also harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year as like the hemp plant maximum potency is only achieved after flowering occurs but unlike the hemp plant and for that matter unlike most herbs the entire base plant of shangrila zowie wowie leave stem  root is all viripotent which makes this gnarly stoke a botanical phenomenon as well most potentiating factors of shangrila as well as the primary botanical factor of shangrila will not achieve viripotency if grown in our hemisphere therefore shangrila is indeed a multinational multicomplicated agricultural undertaking however all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile secondly the potentiating infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of shangrila has also taken a lon g time to bring into potent fruition as there are

left the   scene somewhere between the release of 25 and now    i checked on a number of small messages in a big folder 10000   msgs the delay of the next button has increased considerably    25release 350450 msec  latest cvs 100012000 msec    frankly i think this is getting close to nonacceptable since the   user settings hasnt changed    anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared  heres a fix that i think will make a real difference  ftocshowsequences needs to be able to be called with an optional list of msgids  to update and if its called that way it only removes or adds tags for those  messages  then in places like msgchange we only update the messages which have changed  also a separate ftocshowsequence function which only updates the display of  one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids   in a place like msgchange it would only need to update the cur sequence  if nobody else gets to it ill do this when i get back

kharealumnicaltechedu   vast detail on towers collapse may be sealed  september 30 2002 by james glanz and eric lipton         what is almost certainly the most sophisticated and complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin towers of the world trade center fell has been compiled as part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in lower manhattan   amassed during the initial stages of a complicated insurance lawsuit involving the trade center the confidential material contains data and expert analysis developed by some of the nations most respected engineering minds it includes computer calculations that have produced a series of threedimensional images of the crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to the collapses   an immense body of documentary evidence like maps of the debris piles rare photos and videos has also been accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what government analysts have been able to put together as they struggle to answer the scientifically complex and emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly failures of the buildings   but everyone from structural engineers to relatives of victims fear that the closely held information which includes the analysis and the possible answers that families and engineers around the world have craved may remain buried in sealed files or even destroyed   bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients the experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they wait for the case to play out such restrictions are typical during the discovery phase of litigation and as it now stands the judge in the case  who has agreed that certain material can remain secret for the time being  has approved standard legal arrangements that should the lawsuit be settled before trial could cause crucial material generated by the competing sides to be withheld   were obviously in favor of releasing the information but we cant until were told what to do said matthys levy an engineer and founding partner at weidlinger associates who is a consultant in the case and the author of why buildings fall down how structures fail norton 2nd edition 2002   lets just say we understand the mechanics of the whole process of the collapse mr levy said   monica gabrielle who lost her husband richard when the south tower fell and who is a member of the skyscraper safety campaign said the information should be disclosed if they have answers and are not going to share them i would be devastated mrs gabrielle said they have a moral obligation   the lawsuit that has generated the information involves larry a silverstein whose companies own a lease on the trade center property and a consortium of insurance companies mr silverstein maintains that each jetliner that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist attack entitling him to some 7 billion rather than half that amount as the insurance companies say   as both sides have prepared their arguments they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert opinion about exactly what happened to the towers   dean davison a spokesman for industrial risk insurers of hartford one of the insurance companies in the suit said of the findings there are some confidentiality agreements that are keeping those out of the public domain today he conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20 insurers on his side of the case could complicate any release of the material   as for his own company whose consultants alone have produced more than 1700 pages of analysis and thousands of diagrams and photographs mr davison said every attempt would be made to give the material eventually to public authorities and investigative teams   still some of that analysis relies on information like blueprints and building records from other sources like the port authority of new york and new jersey which built and owned the trade center and supports mr silverstein in the suit mr davison said he was uncertain how the differing origins of the material would influence his companys ability to release information   in a statement the port authority said access to documents would be decided on a casebycase basis consistent with applicable law and policy adding that it would cooperate with federal investigations   the fate of the research is particularly critical to resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into the buildings collapse that investigation led by the federal emergency management agency was plagued by few resources a lack of access to crucial information like building plans and infighting among experts and officials a new federal investigation intended to remedy those failings has just begun at the national institute of standards and technology or nist an agency that has studied many building disasters   officials with nist have said it could take years to make final determinations and recommendations for other buildings a process they now acknowledge might be speeded up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on the lawsuit   gerald mckelvey a spokesman for mr silverstein said of the real estate executives own heavily financed investigative work we decline to comment other than to say that silverstein is cooperating fully with the nist investigation a spokesman for the agency confirmed it was in discussions with mr silverstein on the material but said no transfer had taken place   with no shortage of money or expertise investigations by both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body of science and theory some of it relevant not only to the trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well   the work should be available to other investigators said ramon gilsanz a structural engineer and managing partner at gilsanz murray steficek who was a member of the earlier inquiry it could be used to build better buildings in the future   legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such information in some cases litigants who paid for the reports may make them public themselves or they may ask to have them sealed forever  it is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep some of those documents secret for one reason or another some legitimate some not said lee levine a first amendment lawyer at levine sullivan  koch in washington   mr levine said that because of the presumed value of the information the court might look favorably on requests to make it public but the uncertainty over the fate of the material is unnerving to many people especially experts who believe that only a complete review of the evidence  not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect their own interests  could lead to an advance in the federal investigation of the trade center   its important for this to get presented and published and subjected to some scrutiny said dr john osteraas director of civil engineering practice at exponent failure analysis in menlo park calif and a consultant on the case because then the general engineering community can sort it out   the scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by any measure mr levy and his colleagues at weidlinger associates hired by silverstein properties have called upon powerful computer programs originally developed with the pentagon for classified research to create a model of the sept 11 attack from beginning to end   the result is a compilation of threedimensional images of the severed exterior columns smashed floor and damaged core of the towers beginning with the impacts and proceeding up to the moments of collapse those images  which mr levy is not allowed to release  have helped pinpoint the structural failures   the fema investigators did not have access to such computer modeling nor did the fema team have unfettered access to the trade center site with all its evidence in the weeks immediately after the attacks but no such constraints hampered engineers at lzathorntontomasetti brought to the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of sept 11 daniel a cuoco the company president and a consultant to silverstein properties on the case said he had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how the towers fell   though the fema team could not determine where things actually fell mr cuoco said weve indicated the specific locations   mr cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details of the findings nor would mr osteraas discuss the details of computer calculations his company has done on the spread of fires in large buildings like the twin towers mr osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of photographs and videos of the towers that day some of which he believes have not been available to other investigators   and the investigation has not limited itself to computers and documentary evidence for months experiments in wind tunnels in the united states and canada have been examining the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed the weakening structures   jack cermak president of cermak peterka peterson in fort collins colo was retained by the insurance companies but had previously performed windtunnel studies for the original design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago for the legal case dr cermak said weve done probably more detailed measurements than in the original design   the data that have been acquired are very valuable in themselves for understanding how wind and buildings interact dr cermak said some of the information may be valuable for the litigation he said adding i think ive told you all i can

re re3 selling wedded bliss was re ouchhere are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes with  no reference to sexual preference that i could find the point would seem to  be that 1 sexual activity follows a power curve with a few people a la  wilt chamberlain having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts  ev en in a short period of time and 2 a tendency for men to have more  partners than women  i have no idea being a statistical ignoramus whether  the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely  promiscuous end of the sexpartnersdistribution curve means that youd get  even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other  men    httppolymerbueduamaralsexpartnerscontentsexhtml     as for gay men there is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme  promiscuity among gay men you can read about it in randy schiltzs and the  band played on he writes about  bathhouse culture prehiv he also discusses  how in the gay politics of the time there was a subculture of what you  might call radical gay men who argued and acted on the argument that having  many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was it was an  explicitly political statement monogamy is an artifact of straight culture     that view seems to have died in more ways than one part of the point of  schiltzs book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played  in spreading the aids epidemic that eventually killed schiltz among so many  others this doesnt let eugen off the hookbut it is accurate to say that  there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community  tom   ,ham,ham

iris  i have two different hats to wear in talking to enron  one is as a  financial economist  the other as the director of the newly formed  global  mobility innovation initiative  gmii    this is the research project  funded by lucent  involving bu  lbs  and insead  to study various aspects  of the mobile internet  read 3 g    on the former i am working with a couple of ph  d  students in understanding   a  details of how having physical supply  inventory  can be used by a  market maker  this is a problem that has been studies in the context of  specialists inventory in the stock market but i think really interesting in  the way enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth  i  think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber that is in the  ground    b  how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market  this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss   having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another  all of the incomplete contracting   asymmetric information  and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models  but they are real in practice  my impression is enron  s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining    c  how enron manages the various books that involve physicals  financials   credit etc  this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore  include non  linear risk profiles  the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years   on the gmii front  i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber  i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue  i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room   i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues  perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call  clearly  having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me   as for schedules  the first 3 weeks of april are horrible  april 26  27   may 3  4 are good for me   regards  nalin  at 06  56 pm 03  22  2001  mack  iris wrote    hi      as we

uspacific  to mikemichaelmoorecom  cc foibianbellcom  subject politicos re bowling for columbine opens this friday   michael   why is it that people who consider voting in an election an   inconvenience would go to see a movie to show support for its message    dont get me wrong  i think this is the case  people will go to   see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to   express their malice and discontent towards not only the present   regime in america but also the corrupt empty shallow pantomime   which cast them into power   in reality today the voting that takes place via the act of   consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth   and dimpling the appropriate chad or some other such convoluted act   of free democratic expression   why  because in america they believe in dollars  dollars dont lie    in practise they are the last frontier of truth in america   universally accepted as expressions of fear desire passion and   need  compared to the swing of the almighty buck and jeb bush knows   this a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning   given that fact i modestly propose an entirely new though wholly   logical extension to the current democratic system in place in   america   i propose we augment and effectively replace the electoral system   with a political stock market  we should accept that politicians are   entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in america and   embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects   their intent  a politician should issue a constant number of shares   dependent upon his tenure in government  those shares should be   traded on an open exchange say the greed short of course for   the global realists electoral exchange  democratic  politicians   we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their   ability to maintain office grows  as the truth about their embezzling   campaign funds for weekend trips to maui with their interns is   revealed of course their fortunes will fall   this represents an opportunity for the market forces  those same   forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal   protest  to voice their opinion on the quality of americas   governance during the intervening four years between elections    elections themselves will in effect become meaningless as they are   now since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each   and every congressman senator and presidential candidate   just think of the coverage that could be given on msnbc  strom   thurman strom news  quotes was down 15 today on fears that his   latest heart operation will render him unable to attend senate armed   services committee meetings until november  this would provide   rejuvenating content to the econopolitical news sector which has   found posteconomicbubble coverage to be both tiresome and   deoressing  the establishment of this new stock exchange would of   course create jobs for newly unemployed and governmentally retrained   it systems engineers who could after passing the electoral securities   exam become floor traders   this would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which   candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their   multibilliondollar campaigns  the requirement for the support of   legions of spin doctors permanent campaign managers and investor   relations personnel would also create jobs  perhaps even a new   practice for ernst  young arthur anderson et al  insider trading   scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch   martha stewart as an unwitting beneficiary thus spreading her   influence to politics   dividends if there are any on record at the close of a politicians   career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings    pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support   necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the beltway set    union funds brokerages and even pumpanddump houses could benefit   from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the   southeast and the bush governmet would be allowed to place social   security bets where they really mattered   investors who lose their   retirement life savings and support could rest assured that they   were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors   although theres no way to protect any of these for worldcomlike   crashes ambitious inspired district attorneys could file criminal   suits against candidates and campaign managers who underperform   expectations thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty    instead they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves   on the whole i believe the system could work  i could certainly work   as well as our beloved securities trading industry and given the   american electoral systems success at effectively expressing the will   of the people it certainly couldnt do any worse   in the meantime mike i think ill go see your movie and try to   depose the president   ian     on wednesday october 9 2002 at 0353 pm michael moores mailing   list wrote   october 9 2002   my film bowling for columbine opens this friday   dear friends fans and fellow evildoers   i am very happy and excited to tell you that this friday october 11   my  new  film bowling for columbine will open in new york and los angeles   it is i promise the last thing the bushies want projected on the   movie  screens across america this week the film is first and foremost a  devastating indictment of the violence that is done in our name for   profit  and power  and no one in all the advance screenings i have   attended has  left the theatre with anything short of rage i truly believe this   film has  the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do   something   this is not good news for junior and company not when they are   trying to  drag us into another war not when a crazed sniper is exercising his  constitutional right to own a highpowered rifle not when john   ashcroft is  still prohibiting the fbi from looking through the gun background   check  files to see if any of the 19 hijackers or their associates purchased   any  weapons prior to 911  because that we are told would violate   these  terrorists sacred second amendment rights   yes i believe this movie can create a lot of havoc  but i will   need all  of you to help me do this are you game   last february 5th i wrote to tell you about a book i had written and   how  the publisher had decided to dump it because they were afraid to   publish  anything critical of bush after 911 i appealed to you to save   stupid  white men from the shredder and to go out and buy it i promised you   would  not regret it and that the book would not only be a great read but an  important organizing tool in gumming up the plans of george w bush   within 24 hours the book went to 1 on the amazon best seller list   by the  fifth day the book was already into its 9th printing the publisher   was  torn between its desire to kill the book or make a wad of money   greed won  out and this sunday the book enters its 31st week on the new york   times  best seller list  and its 32nd printing this is all because of   you my  crazy and loyal friends you made this happen against all the odds   now i would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work   bowling  for columbine its a movie that many critics have already called my   best  film to date they may be right it is certainly the most provocative   thing  i have ever done i have spent three years on it and i have to say   it  cuts  deeper harder and funnier that anything i have given you so far   the movie opens this friday in new york and los angeles and then in   8 more  cities next week how it does in these first ten cities will determine  whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it that is the   nutty  way  our films are released if it doesnt have a big opening weekend you   can  kiss the film goodbye therefore this weekend this film must be   seen by  millions of americans can you help me make that happen   bowling for columbine is not a film simply about guns or school  shootings  that is only the starting point for my 2hour journey into the dark   soul of  a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of   violence  both at home and around the world with this movie i have broadened my  canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the 21st  century a nation that seems hellbent on killing first and asking  questions  later it is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and  terrorism against our own poor and how we have created a culture of   fear  that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore and its a  devastating comedy   this film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts no film has   ever  said the things i am saying in bowling for columbine i expect to be  attacked i expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of  retribution i expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many   to  swallow   this is why i need your help movies live or die based on what   happens at  the box office the first weekend of its release i need you if you   live in  the new york or la area to go see bowling for columbine this   friday  and  saturday  and take as many family members and friends with you as  possible i guarantee you will not be disappointed  and you may   just see  one of the best films of the year   monday night in times square bowling for columbine had its   premiere the  crowd was amazing as it was this past saturday night at the chicago   film  festival the audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud  throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line   the hate mail the threats the promises of retribution have already  started  to roll in to the distributor of this movie united artists they are   not  backing down but how long will this last i need all of you in the   new  york  tristate and southern california areas to go see bowling for   columbine  this weekend  the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when   it  comes to your town a strong opening not only means that the rest of  america  will see this film it means that a good number of people who see it   are  going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved   if it  does poorly i will have a difficult time finding the funding for the   movie  i want to make next  a film about 911 and how bush is using that   tragic  day as a cover for his rightwing agenda   dont let that happen dont let the nra have one more success by   stopping  the wider distribution of this movie and together let us not remain  silent in our opposition to bushs phony war against iraq   if you live in new york you can see it at the lincoln plaza the   sunshine  and the loews 19th st in la you can catch it at the sunset 5 the  westwood regent laemmle sunset laemmle towncenter encino landmark  rialto pasadena and regal university irvine also please   forward this  to your other friends and tell them to go see bowling for columbine   this  weekend   and finally dont miss our new website wwwbowlingforcolumbinecom   thank you for your help with this i feel so honored and privileged   to have  so many people interested in my work last january i was getting   70000  hits  a month on my website last month i got 17 million hits this alone   speaks  volumes

subject california power 1  19  00  executive summary   sb  7 x gives dept  of water and resources given legislative authority to  undertake short  term power purchases with no price cap through feb  2 nd  new legislation  ab  1 x and sb  6 x  would seek  1  long  term contracts with 5  5  cent cap and  2  creation of california power and conservation financing  authority  the long  term contracts proposed in ab  1 x are likely to be subject to  significant amendment and renegotiation prior to the feb  2 nd expiration of  sb  7 x   the authority proposed in sb  6 x would have bond issuance powers to finance  new generation capacity and conservation measures  negotiations under way on using bond authority for a utility  bailout   utilities and state government split over debt obligations of  utility parents  state borrowing plans and power purchases create credit risks for state  treasury  socal edison misses more payments  bush administration opposes price caps  but is supporting state efforts to  split pg we believe he then could be willing to guarantee or  issue  bonds to deal with the rest   as one very senior california political leader explained  getting the utility  holding companies to eat a substantial part of the debt they owe themselves  is the key to solving the back debt problem without provoking widespread  public outrage about a  bailout  of private price  gouging companies with  taxpayer money  since 75  of californians currently blame the utilities and  the puc for this crisis  and only 10  blame davis   this is a crucial  political stance for the governor   but  of course  absorbing anything like  6 billion in debt would be quite a  shock to the seemingly healthy holding company and power  generating branches  of the two utilities  and they began spreading the word that they were quite  willing to accept bankruptcy  thus by mid  week  both  sides had pushed themselves toward a resolution in federal bankruptcy court  that would be a worst case solution for all sides  the country  s economy  would  suffer from the resulting credit shock  the governor  s political future would  suffer from the electricity rate increases almost certain to be mandated by a  bankruptcy judge  while most private sector legal authorities believe the  utilities corporate holding structure would ultimately be breached during  bankruptcy  procedures and they would end up having to absorb some significant amount of  the debt in the end  in addition  they would most likely face a state  government  determined to use state powers of condemnation to enter the power business in  a major way   senator burton  s sb 6 x legislation will strengthen those powers dramatically  to make this point quite explicit  it would set up a  california power and  conservation  financing authority   with the power to issue bonds and invoke eminent  domain  it would finance new power plants  and  consider the feasibility and  public  interest of the state acquiring  operating  and maintaining transmission  facilities currently owned by investor  owned and municipal utilities    as we write this  all sides are trying to construct a path back down from the  bankruptcy ledge to safe ground  and there is no question the tone has  shifted  in the last 24 hours from macho confrontation to  maybe we  ve run this thing  out as far as we can   but as we have noted  the chance for miscalculation is  still quite high  there is no solution agreed to at this time  the stand  off  over how much debt the state government will absorb versus the utilities   holding  company is continuing  and the technical fact of default still makes it  possible for some bank to trigger bankruptcy by demanding immediate  accelerated payment   5  default update  thursday  socal edison   215 million default to california power exchange   after edison failed to make a  215 m electricity payment yesterday  the  california power authority began seizing long  term contacts and reselling  them to recoup some of the money owed to generators  pg  e said it expects  its trading privileges at the cal  power authority to be suspended today   leaving them with only its generation from nuclear and hydroelectric sources   while the ongoing wave of defaults has severely restricted pg  e  s and socal  s  ability to buy power  the department of water and resources will be able to  pick up some of the slack  at least in the very short  term   the state itself may be getting into risky credit territory  the proposed  california public power authority would borrow in the neighborhood of  1  3  billion from the state general fund in advance of this year  s expected fiscal  surplus  with the loan to be repaid by the authority from expected future  revenues  with near  bankrupt utilities and a freeze on rate hikes  it is  unclear where the revenues would come from  the amount borrowed and terms of  repayment will be no doubt examined very carefully by the bond rating  agencies   5  bush policies  as we reported on wednesday  the bush administration continues to demonstrate  little interest in getting involved in the california crisis   president  elect bush surprised state leaders yesterday with his comments   which essentially said that excessive environmental regulation was the root  of the current supply shortage  bush and his top officials appear to be  unanimously opposed to long  term price caps   however  there is one issue of considerable importance to the administration   according to a source close to a top bush economic advisor  there is  significant concern that pg  e  s credit problems could cause gas suppliers to  stop shipments of gas through pg  e  s pipeline  the risk would be that the  pipeline could  go dry   causing significant and possibly dangerous  disruptions in california residences and businesses  to prevent this  problem  bush is working with davis on a proposal to split pg  e into separate  gas and electric companies  the gas company would be solvent  but the  electric company would go immediately into ch  11 following significant  defaults ,ham,ham

exists explicitly to deal with spammers while were getting judgments against them and especially in other countries where those judgments are harder to get  please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers  yes some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes and isps have won some theft of service suits but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles  so i cant understand how daniel can assert that you cant track spammers down when its never really been tried  we can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of  we can subpoena the records of the isp that provided them service and of the credit card they used for the whackamole accounts  we can use private investigators  yes these people are often lowlifes chickenboners  but theyre not secret agents  theyre just trying to make a buck and habeas whole business is about finding them and putting them out of business  habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers that use our warrant mark in a way that no one ever has had before  given that our whole business plan relies on habeas becoming synonymous with not spam i cant understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful plan for that failure and in so doing remove the potential of success which is antispam filters like sa acting on the habeas warrant mark  daniel its easy enough for you to change the habeas scores yourself on your installation  if habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to nonspammers and to place all violators on the hil then i have no doubt that justin and craig will quickly remove us from the next release  but youre trying to kill habeas before it has a chance to show any promise  at the end of the day spamassassin is like the club in that it encourages thieves spammers to just go after the next car those without sa rather than yours  habeas can play the role of lojack the transmitter in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they dont steal any more cars  but only if were given a chance to succeed             dan  dan kohn mailtodandankohncom httpwwwdankohncom  tel16503272600

cline mattnightrealmscom writes   there must be some way of tracking a spammer down since they are  planning on making money from the spam  what a court would consider  evidence of being the spammer is another question  haha  just a few notes    it will be difficult to find prosecute and win money from someone    in various nonfriendly countries where spam originates china is a    good example even if they do officially respect copyright law    law suits take time between now and conclusion of the first court    case we could have years of spam in our mail boxes    contact information can change phone numbers po boxes stolen    cell phones temporary email addresses etc    spammers do not always remember to include contact information  i    dont understand it either but nobody said they were bright  also    some spam is noncommercial or sent by a thirdparty for example    pump and dump stock scams so contact information is not strictly    required for the spammer to get their way

subject the storage revolution has begun  network world fusion focus  amy larsen decarlo  on storage in the enterprise  today  s focus  the storage revolution has begun  03  07  00  dear wincenty kaminski   today  s focus  the storage revolution has  begun  by amy larsen decarlo  believe the hype  we are in the middle of a storage revolution   virtually overnight  businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to  terabytes of data  and the number of users accessing that information is  skyrocketing  the subsequent requirements are forcing companies to  rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of  storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery   it isn   t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that  are changing how businesses handle storage  the premium that companies  place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound  effect on their storage requirements  businesses demand fault  tolerant  storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their  employees  suppliers and customers   but given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements  on average   double every 12 months  while processor speeds double every 18 months   companies are left with a quandary  how can they manage the  proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for  the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds   the simple answer to this question is to institute a well  executed  storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in  advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support  those needs  bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not  from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those  systems   there are several ways to efficiently manage storage  one of the best  routes is consolidation that is  pooling resources and managing  storage as a system  as opposed to a decentralized collection of file  servers  this may sound like a throwback to an earlier era  when  enterprise storage resided on mainframes  but it   s actually a  progressive step  as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing  the planning  management  and ongoing support of storage systems than it  does with the physical location of the files   next  it is important to recognize that not all information is equally  important to the organization  consequently  storage requirements vary  by business application  as in all areas of it  it is important to make  storage implementation decisions based on business needs   businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for  alternatives to the distributed file server storage model  they want to  speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth  intensive backup and  recovery operations from the lan   network  attached storage  nas  supplies it professionals with one  answer  giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to  stored data  nas devices  which have been widely available for years   are optimized to process i  o transactions  though they promise better  performance  they don   t remove backups from the transport network   instead  they supply a relatively easy  to  deploy solution to cross   platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments   many consider storage  area networks  san  to be the best long  term  answer to current and future storage challenges  because sans are  designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network  they  alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated  with more traditional storage models  yet  given the early deployment  stage most companies are still in  many of those capabilities are still  largely untested in a production environment   this newsletter will examine how  through effective storage management   it professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery  to their customers  this newsletter will not focus on items like the  least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library  instead  it will  look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging  technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues   ultimately  the goal is to identify storage technology options and  practices that work in real  world

seen articles on this type of stuff passing through various forums for several years  ive always found archaeology interesting for no particular reason  here is a recent article from us news that i actually still have in the dank recesses of my virtual repository  james rogers  jamesrbestcom    httpwwwusnewscomusnewsissue020916misc16meltdownhtm  defrosting the past  ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers a bounty of a warming world  by alex markels  as he hiked near colorados continental divide in the summer of 2001 ed knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13000 feet it looked like a bison skull the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls i thought thats strange bison dont live this high up   knapp brought the skull to the denver museum of nature and science where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bisonone that died about 340 years ago this was an extraordinary discovery says russ graham the museums chief curator adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago theres probably a lot more like it yet to be found  and not just bison colorado isnt the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting decades of unusual warmth in regions from peru to alaskaa trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industryhave shrunk or thawed many of the worlds 70000 glaciers as the ice recedes a treasuretrove of human and animal artifacts is emerging extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze the fabrics wood bone and dnarich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists understanding of our predecessors health habits and technology and the prey they pursued  its mindboggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains says johan reinhard a highaltitude archaeologist and explorerinresidence at the national geographic society rare spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the andes of peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5300yearold ice man found at the edge of a receding glacier in the alps in 1991 have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information now as the ice continues to retreat it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains  vanishing act the trick is finding such specimens before mother natureand looterstake them first once uncovered frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals moreover theyre often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them dont even realize theyre ancient  that was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in british columbia canada three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal it looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice recalls warren ward a teacher from nearby nelson but when i looked closer i could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones  figuring they had found the remains of another hunter or perhaps a fur trapper the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a ziploc bag and delivered them to local officials archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunters body along with a woven hat fur clothing and what seemed to be a medicine bag carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago dubbed kwaday dan tsinchi or long ago person found by people of the champagne and aishihik first nations who may be his direct descendants he is perhaps the bestpreserved human from the period ever found in north america  other findings from melting ice in the neighboring yukon region could explain what that longago person was doing in the mountains in the first place before this there was no archaeological record of people living here says greg hare a yukon government archaeologist now we see that this area was very much part of peoples seasonal activities  like wards discovery the search began by chance when kristin benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband gerry kuzyk hunted sheep at 6000 feet in the mountains of the south yukon they followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung it was really odd because i knew there hadnt been caribou in the area for at least 100 years recalls kuzyk then a wildlife biologist with the yukon government  caribou cake returning a week later he found what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it it turned out to be a 4300yearold atlatl or spear thrower further investigation of the ice patchand scores of others around the regionrevealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7800 years of changing hunting practices  scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies hunters followed the game they returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice weve got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1200 years ago says hare who now oversees the research project then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about 1300 years ago and by 1200 years ago theres no more throwing darts  now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck they are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in alaskas wrangell and st elias mountain rangesthe united states most glaciated terrainand in the andes johan reinhard thinks the fast thawing european alps could also deliver more findings perhaps as exquisite as the ice man global warming is providing us highaltitude archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now were probably about the only ones happy about it     ,ham,ham

possibility of forwarding all  internal and internet email to his aol mailbox when hes out  of the office and i figure its going to be a piece of  cake he recently acquired a new phone through verizon along  with web access and a tie into his aol mailbox which was  the driving force behind this request what i found was that  internet email proved to be easy using a simple forwarding  rule but none of the internal exchange email was being sent  out to the internet upon receipt even though it appeared to  be included in the rule as it happens this is due to a  default configuration option on the exchange 55 server that  prevents automatic repliesforwards from being sent to the  internet using the exchange internet mail service a quick  configuration change and restart of ims will put things

windows xp and i did indeed run through it prior to  attempting an inplace upgrade obviously with no  improvement its still worth a mention however in case  youre not familiar with what its there for as youre  probably aware xp contains a file protection scheme that  will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or  altered in any way ensuring that xp is kept in a stable  state sometimes this system can get a little out of whack  and the sfc is meant to restore order note that any  hotfixes and other microsoftprovided updates will be left  in place since they properly update the dll cache that is  used as the sanity check to determine if a system file has  been messed with to access the sfc simply launch a command  prompt and type sfc to display a list of options

start asking about their  opinions on technology laws that are being proposed left and  right holding a public office seems to be introducing brain  death more frequently considering proposals by senator fritz  hollings and now la congressman howard berman if mr berman  gets his way companies may very well be allowed to hack  into your systems without proof of provocation in order to  ensure that you are using their software according to the  stated rules mind you if they cause colateral damage or  upset other systems there isnt thing one you can do in  return nope theyll have legal protection this garbage is  seriously getting scary if you think it wont be abused  consider the case of dimitry skylarov when he publicly  pointed out ebook security problems with adobes software

re ilug slashdot ew dijkstra humorgary coady wrote  oops i tend to feel like that most times i tend to feel that if we  have extremely good compilation tools then those tools should be able  to do the inlining and optimisation far better than i could thats the  theory anyway  and theres always a tradeoff with inlining between  speed and memory bloat which may sometimes be no tradeoff if swap  starts getting involved   this is something that often annoys me programmers can spend hours inlining code and relying on optimisation tools to improve performance the best performance improvement can be obtained by fixing the algorithm  most function calls get made very rarely optimising them often makes no sense produces illegable code and nonsense algorithms  inlining will help in functions that get called frequently and are small  such as string manipulation routines but these are a small part of most applications  one example i frequently see is people optimising a database function call most database accesses involve many abstraction layers and millions of instruction cycles trying to save a few instruction cycles would be a cost saving of say 5 seconds in 20 hours  but a simple hashmap cache of common data without any compiler or inline optimisations can turn that same 20 hours into 10 minutes     matthew who really should be writing code    do you yahoo everything youll ever need on one web page from news and sport to email and music charts httpukmyyahoocom     irish linux users group iluglinuxie httpwwwlinuxiemailmanlistinfoilug for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie   ,ham,ham

re a moment of silence for the first amendment  angry liberal yutesrussell turpin wrote    gregory alan bolcer  im not sure since i havent attended civics class  in quite some time but the first amendment doesnt cover protected speech  hate speech or actions     the first two are wrong the first amendment does  protect speech the supreme court decides it protects  duh and that happens to include most of what  people consider hate speech unlike many other  nations the us has no laws against hate speech per  se and the first amendment is the reason for that     this was poking fun of the practice of making up differnt types of speech with different types of protected status  i think the laws specialing out hate and protected speech are ridiculous  the point i keep trying to make is that theres only two types speech and action  i agree they are all speech and should be  covered by the first amendment but  if hate speech is so protected why are certain states trying to prosecute people for it  theres only two answers and one of them is wrong    1 because hate speech is different and needs to      have a different level of protection dictated      by whoevers offended at the time   2 its because its not just speech but action      a action whos consequences are foreseeable by       any reasonable person   hate speech is mislabeled  its really threat  i think they let the mislabeling perpetuate as theres advantage in being able to counterthreat with loss of liberty and money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people they dont like     greg       join the worlds largest email service with msn hotmail  httpwwwhotmailcom   ,ham,ham

subject p  option valuation model  mark   after recently reviewing the booking of the p  options  it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes  i  e  the price process assumptions are consistent with standard black  76 model assumptions extended to two commodities    the payoff for a call option is   payoff  max  0  a  b  k    where   a  nxwti  delivery price for nymex   b  posting price   wti swap    posting basis   k  posting bonus  fixed    the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options is that leg  b  of the spread is a combination of three prices  the two futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month  and the average posting basis during the delivery month  combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg  b  and the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of prices and its correlation with the nxwti price  i believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative  which would be to use a three or four  commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices   in summary  i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options  assuming that the inputs are set correctly   regards   stinson gibner  v  p  research,ham,ham

re boot  lvm best practices if youre going to buy two drives youd be stupid to not use   mirroring for fault tolerance and a little added read performance   here and there depends on application   i disagree  mirroring only protects you against drive failures and not   human error   and i disagree with that    with the fact that its not necessarily stupid to not use mirroring     mirroring definitely makes both reads and writes go faster due   to parallelism    afaik thats not true for writes they may even slow down slightly  but in any case this does not contradict the fact that the kind of  protection it offers is different from the one offered by using backup              stefan         to unsubscribe email to debianuserrequestlistsdebianorg   with a subject of unsubscribe trouble contact listmasterlistsdebianorg  archive httplistsdebianorgjwvtyrdlw3cfsfmonniergmanelinuxdebianusergnuorg      ,ham,ham

applications for the neubia distributed clearing platform  this release contains early java libraries and documentation that would primarily be of interest to developers  talking about documentation it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented towards people with experience in javaxml development  there are currently no sample applications but they will be available in the next release  the framework currently contains the following  classes for creating named objects which are authenticated using digital signatures within a hierarchy  storage framework for named objects  simple xmlsignature implementation almost certainly not yet interoperable with other implementations  simple soap client  simple servlet api for handling soap requests based on named   objects  current types of named objects include     namespace objects  for maintaining the namespace authentication  	framework     authenticationtickets  for doing web site authentication using 	digital signatures   next major release is scheduled to contain   core 	hard coded root public key for authenticating top level 	namespaces   signing services 	implementation of web based signing services 	end user hosted signing service   example user authentication application   example payment system based on neudist  i will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks this will cover not only more indepth technical documentation but also higher level documentation about the business side of things  read more about neudist or download our early version at httpneudistorg i would love to hear your

sunwell it looks like sun are going ahead with their ubiquitous computing plans without mithril   greg  reuters market news   sun micro outlines roadmap for managing networks    friday september 20 500 am et    by peter henderson     san francisco reuters  computer maker sun microsystems inc on thursday   said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as   straightforward to handle as a single machine a strategy it calls n1    it laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld   unwieldy networks into easytouse systems a goal similar to those of most rivals   making computers which manage networks    emc corp announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage   resources as a pool hewlettpackard co has a utility data center designed for   broader management international business machines corps project eliza is working   to make computers selfhealing when systems break    applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the   whole idea behind n1 is you stop thinking about that you dont think about what box   it is running on sun vice president steve mackay head of the n1 program said in an   interview on the sidelines of a sun user conference     many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or   water as a utility that can be turned on or off in whatever volume one wants whenever   needed    for that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly rather than cobbling   them together with tenuous links as most networks do today experts say there are   still major barriers though such as communications standards for machines from   different vendors to interoperate closely    sun promised to deliver a virtualization engine that would let administrators look at   their entire network as a pool by the end of the year network administrators today   often have no automatic system to report what is in the network     itll tell you what you have and how it is laid out promised mackay   the second stage beginning in 2003 would allow users to identify a service such as   online banking and allocate resources for them with a few clicks sun said    finally in 2004 suns software should allow networks to change uses of resources on   the fly in response to changing needs such as a bank assuring quicker online response   time for priority users the company said   ,ham,ham

cheeky letter to the editors of the economist follows along with the  article i was commenting on rohit  in your article about chinese attempts to censor google last week the  search goes on sept 19th the followup correctly noted that the most  subversive aspect of googles service is not its card catalog which  merely points surfers in the right direction but the entire library by  maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire world wide web  if you can get to googles cache you can read anything youd like  the techniques chinese internet service providers are using to enforce  these rules however all depend on the fact that traffic to and from  google or indeed almost all public websites is unencrypted almost all  web browsers however include support for secure sockets layer ssl  encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like upgrading to  ssl makes it effectively impossible for a maninthemiddle to meddle  censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in  china the only choice left is to either ban the entire site range of  ip addresses but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in  the article  of course the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic  costs real money if the united states is so concerned about the free  flow of information why shouldnt the broadcasting board of governors  sponsor an encrypted interface to google or for that matter the rest  of the web  to date public diplomacy efforts have focused on publicsector  programming for the voice of america radio sawa and the like just  imagine if the us government got into the business of subsidizing secure  access to privatesector media instead nothing illustrates the freedom  of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself  and most  of it is already salted away at google and the internet archive project  on second thought i can hardly imagine this administration promoting  the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights never mind  best    rohit khare    the search goes on china backtracks on banning googleup to a point  sep 19th 2002  beijing  from the economist print edition  in chinese the nickname for google an american internet search engine  is gougou meaning doggy for the countrys fastgrowing population of  internet users 46m according to an official estimate it is proving  an elusive creature earlier this month the chinese authorities blocked  access to google from internet service providers in chinaapparently  because the search engine helped chinese users to get access to  forbidden sites now after an outcry from those users access has been  restored  an unusual climbdown by chinas zealous internet censors hardly more  sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to  use google to search for material deemed offensive to the government  access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by  google as it trawls the internet these once provided a handy way for  chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites  after the blocking of google on august 31st many chinese internet users  posted messages on bulletin boards in china protesting against the move  their anger was again aroused last week when some chinese internet  providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked google site  to far less powerful search engines in china  duncan clark the head of a beijingbased technology consultancy firm  bda china ltd says china is trying a new tactic in its efforts to  censor the internet until recently it had focused on blocking  individual sites including all pages stored on them now it seems to be  filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key  words that might indicate undesirable content for example earlier this  week when using eastnet a beijingbased internet provider a search on  google for falun gonga quasibuddhist exercise sect outlawed in china usually aborted before all the results had time to appear such a search  also rendered google impossible to use for several minutes   ,ham,ham

spambayes test setsguido on the classifier pickle on sf  i downloaded and played with it a bit but had no time to do anything  systematic  cool   it correctly recognized a spam that slipped through sa  ditto   but it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any  mime structure or html parts and several messages in my saved zope  geeks list that happened to be using mime andor html  do you know why  the strangest implied claim there is that it hates mime independent of html  for example the spamprob of contenttypetextplain in that pickle is under 021  contenttypemultipartalternative gets 093 but thats not a killer clue and one bit of good content will more than cancel it out  wrt hating html possibilities include  1 it really had to do with something other than mimehtml  2 these are pure html not multipartalternative with a textplain part    so that the tags arent getting stripped  the pickled classifier    despises all hints of html due to its clpy heritage  3 these are multipartalternative with a textplain part but the    latter doesnt contain the same text as the texthtml part for    example as anthony reported perhaps the textplain part just    says something like this is an hmtl message  if its 2 it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize meaning even if it is pure html strip the tags anyway  in fact id like to do that and default it to true  the extreme hatred of html on tech lists strikes me as umm extreme    so i guess ill have to retrain it yes you told me so   that would be a different experiment  im certainly curious to see whether jeremys muchworsethanmine error rates are typical or aberrant  ,ham,ham

crossplatform developmenthey all    	i realize this has come up before but i am still confused after    reading through the old emails i have an app that uses quicktime for    java i would like to maybe not right away but at some point update    my app to do the right thing the right thing apparently is to use    qtkit because it is the only 64bit solution    	this seems crazy to me though because it is os x specific which    means i need another solution for windows what is the 64bit solution    going to be for windows does this mean every developer who wants to    write crossplatform qt code not just java is supposed to write    their own portability layer for quicktime is there an open source    solution out there or in the works is there another solution that    people are using other than qt    i need file conversion from a wide variety of file types esp audio    and video playback although i will need some editing in the future    jmfjavasound wont cut it not even close i need way more file    formats than they support you used to be able to use qtj as a plugin    for jmf to provide file readingwriting perhaps there is a way to do    that with a minimal qt java layer okay now im just thinking out    loud sorry    	any thoughts advice pointers are appreciated i have not seen the    crossplatform issue addressed and the only replacements for qtj ive    seen are os specific eg rococoa    thanks    	bjorn      bjorn roche  xo wave  digital audio production and postproduction software  httpwwwxowavecom  httpblogbjornrochecom  httpmyspacecomxowave       do not post admin requests to the list they will be ignored  quicktimeapi mailing list      quicktimeapilistsapplecom  helpunsubscribeupdate your subscription  httplistsapplecommailmanoptionsquicktimeapimlsubscribertech40csminingorg    this email sent to mlsubscribertechcsminingorg    ,ham,ham

windows xp and i did indeed run through it prior to  attempting an inplace upgrade obviously with no  improvement its still worth a mention however in case  youre not familiar with what its there for as youre  probably aware xp contains a file protection scheme that  will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or  altered in any way ensuring that xp is kept in a stable  state sometimes this system can get a little out of whack  and the sfc is meant to restore order note that any  hotfixes and other microsoftprovided updates will be left  in place since they properly update the dll cache that is  used as the sanity check to determine if a system file has  been messed with to access the sfc simply launch a command  prompt and type sfc to display a list of options

that you are using their software according to the  stated rules mind you if they cause colateral damage or  upset other systems there isnt thing one you can do in  return nope theyll have legal protection this garbage is  seriously getting scary if you think it wont be abused  consider the case of dimitry skylarov when he publicly  pointed out ebook security problems with adobes software

re use new apt to do null to rh8 upgrade matthias saou matthiasegwnnet wrote  as red hat does i really dont recommend trying to upgrade between betas  or from a beta to a final release either simply backup your home etc  and root andor usrlocal if needed then reinstall cleanly itll  probably save a few hassles and youll get the cleanest possible system     i think this is probably the best way because i think maybe with upgrading you  do not always automatically get the latest feature enabled in some config file  because rh would rather take it easy and not update that config file you get a  rpmnew instead of rpmsaved file so they get less calls to support that way  if you dislike red hat why use it  this was a really bad argument  against using red hat that makes no sense at all  i for one am glad that  they  a dont overwrite your config files on a whim be glad they dont do some  sort of autodetection and changing crap b tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because  formats have changed  red hat is not taking it easy on this its putting control in the hands  of you the maintainer of the machine  dont be lazy   anyway i have tons of media files in home probably 5 to 10 gigs at least my  laptops cdrom takes 700mb at a time obviously and compressing media files is  dumb because they are already compressed dumb question how to backup huge data  network backup to another box i do not have a box with a tape drive but maybe box  with a large hd with much free space could take the backup oops i do not have a  space computer with a large hd with much free space  you dont need to backup home if you are careful enough  you did put  home on a separate partition no  just install rh80 and tell it to use  the same partition as home and tell it to not format it but keep the  data as is  if you didnt put home on a separate partition then you really do need  to make backups  use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup  and rsync straight to the mount or if thats not possible rsync over  ssh  its the best way to make backups   these media files are backed up  on the cds they came from   its the other way around  your media files are backups of the cds they  came from   good luck thomas    the davedina project  future tv today   httpdavedinaapestaartorg                        you know the shape my breath will take before i let it out  thomasapestaartorg  urgent the best radio on the internet  247   httpurgentrugacbe    rpmlist mailing list  httplistsfreshrpmsnetmailmanlistinforpmlist   ,ham,ham

re liberal defnitions read the article  im afraid i dont understand how the transmission prices could have hit 50tcf  but im also really leery of telling a pipeline company they have to run a pipeline at a higher pressure and that they should forego maintenance we had a big pipeline explosion up here awhile ago  so maybe the judge has a point  well see as the appeals work its way out   original message  from geege schuman mailtogeegebarreraorg  sent tuesday september 24 2002 516 am  to johnhallevergonet  subject re liberal defnitions    from slates todays papers  the new york times and los angeles times  both lead with word that  a federal judge ruled yesterday that the nations largest  national gas pipeline company el paso illegally withheld gas  from the market during californias energy squeeze in 200001  the judge concluded that el paso left 21 percent of its capacity  in the state offline thus driving up the price of gas and  helping to induce rolling blackouts    and this is the product of overregulation    original message  from forkadminxentcom mailtoforkadminxentcomon behalf of john  hall  sent monday september 23 2002 1157 pm  to fork  subject liberal defnitions      depends on how much over spending vs how much and what type over  regulation    the biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible  it also has the ability to single out particular people while over  spending spreads the damage more evenly  rent control would be an  example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending  tons of money on public housing    as for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose  both i find no fault in that definition whatsoever  the opinion that  either we are spending too much or we have too much regulation is pretty  much anathema to liberal politics    finally those who argue that there are private replacements for much  government regulation are not saying that a state of nature no private  replacements no government regulation is better than government  regulation itself    and in my experience people who label themselves green which does not  include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly is a  watermelon           original message   from forkadminxentcom mailtoforkadminxentcom on behalf of  geege   schuman     funny i read it as green  red as in accounting as in fiscally   irresponsible  which do you think is the worse indictment    overregulation   or overspending  there are many dickheads who buy into the   neoconservative medias foxs definiton of liberal as one who  seeks   to   impose both          ,ham,ham
the mime information you requested last changed 3154 feb 14  what is mime  mime stands for multipurpose internet mail extensions  it is the standard for how to send multipart multimedia and binary data using the worldwide internet email system  typical uses of mime include sending images audio wordprocessing documents programs or even plain text files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part of the file  mime also allows for labelling message parts so that a recipient or mail program may determine what to do with them   how can i read a mime message  since mime is only a few years old there are still some mailers in use which do not understand mime messages  however there are a growing number of mail programs that have mime support builtin  one popular mimecapable mailer for unix vms and pcs is pine developed at the university of washington and available via anonymous ftp from the host ftpcacwashingtonedu in the file pinepinetarz  in addition several proprietary email systems provide mime translation capability in their internet gateway products  however even if you do not have access to a mimecapable mailer or suitable gateway there is still hope   there are a number of standalone programs that can interpret a mime message  one of the more versatile is called munpack  it was developed at carnegie mellon university and is available via anonymous ftp from the host ftpandrewcmuedu in the directory pubmpack  there are versions available for unix pc mac and amiga systems  for compabibility with older forms of transferring binary files the munpack program can also decode messages in splituuencoded format   does mime replace uuencode  yes  uuencode has been used for some time for encoding binary files so that they can be sent via internet mail but it has several technical limitations and interoperability problems  mime uses a more robust encoding called base64 which has been carefully designed to survive the message transformations made by certain email gateways   how can i learn more about mime  the mime internet standard is described in rfc1521 available via anonymous ftp from many different internet hosts including                                                               o  us east coast                                     address  dsinternicnet 198494510                                                                       o  us west coast                                     address  ftpisiedu 1289032                                                                     o  pacific rim                                       address  munnariozau 128250121                                                                 o  europe                                            address  nicnordunet 1923614817   look for the file rfcrfc1521txt  another source of information is the internet news group compmailmime which includes a periodic posting of a frequently asked questions list   httpxentcommailmanlistinfofork  ,ham,ham

the folder label in the folder list      that the way i have it configured and it sounds as if the way tony does   too just does a move rather than select as target without moving      of course if you can manage to get no messages currently selected then   it works fine         2 in the main window the  key puts you into a change          folder mode the first time you use it after starting exmh         hit a second  and you go to set a target mode  type a few         characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete      this works but is not nice if youre not using the keyboard but just   the mouse      tony i agree  a nice way to link in one click would be good and should   be easy to add though currently adding mouse bindings something like   shift right click would be a good choice is much harder than adding   key bindings      but note theres no need to undo  the way i generally use link if   the desired destination folder isnt the current selected target is   to right click on the target which selects it and moves the message   and because i have the automatic move to the next message on move or   link option set select the message again and then link      exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a   time that is one of delete move or link   selecting any of those   implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three so you cannot   achieve a move by doing a link then delete then commit it needs to   be link commit delete commit  xmh was just the same there incidentally               hows spring shaping up down

techs major declineonce we thought of the internet as this thing with infinite capabilities it was basically just a fad that came along  missing from the article is the percentage of foreign enrolement i would bet the numbers of students from asia china specificly has gone up quite a bit and is the only thing keeping the overall numbers from plummiting  you cant get the chicks with that anymore  about time us geeks were outcasts again i was getting sick of hearing about geeks breeding and ending up with autistic children  proving that intelligence is a genetic defect and a do not breed flag   adam l duncan beberg   httpwwwmithralcombeberg   bebergmithralcom    techs major decline college students turning away from bits and bytes  by ellen mccarthy washington post staff writer tuesday august 27 2002 page e01  if john yandziak had been entering college a few years ago he might have sought a stake in the new economy he might have dreamed of becoming an ace codecracker for the cia or the national security agency or imagined toppling an empire with revolutionary software maybe he would have tried to use the internet to end world hunger  but as yandziak attends his first college classes this week hes harboring different academic ambitions the ashburn native says he wants to do something more social and more interesting than working with computers  besides he said while packing for a charlottesville dormitory room you cant get the chicks with that anymore  the tech industrys financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of some fairweather students but now theres another consequence of the tech bust enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has come to a halt  the number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in 2001 according to a report by the computing research association and educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating with some colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins  the word is out among department deans that the busts fallout has trickled into the classroom said maria clavez president of the association of computing machinery  ive heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic declines said clavez who will become the dean of science and engineering at princeton university in january it can be hard to see this because at some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far exceeds the available space but it is going to have an effect  at virginia tech enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science department will drop 25 percent this year to 300 at george washington university the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer science fell by more than half this year  interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the past decade in 1997 schools with phd programs in computer science and computer engineering granted 8063 degrees according to the computing research association the numbers rose through 2001 when 17048 degrees were awarded  the labor department projects that software engineering will be the fastestgrowing occupation between 2000 and 2010 with other computerrelated industries trailing close behind  but in the short term that growth may slow based on the changes among college students for example 900 of the 2000plus undergraduates studying information technology and engineering at george mason university were computer science majors last year this year the enrollment in that major is down to 800 although a newly created and more general information technology major has attracted 200 students  having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief said lloyd griffith dean of george masons information technology and engineering school particularly with the field as it has been they dont want to spend four years on something and then not get a job  freshman enrollment for the university of marylands computer science major is expected to be about 167 this fall down from 329 last year maryland decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent but that alone does not account for the drop said steve halperin dean of marylands college of computer mathematical and physical sciences  we are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their interest in pursuing computer science as a major halperin said thats a factual statement but i would say that at this point    we dont expect to see a decrease in the number of graduates many of the kids who are no longer expressing an interest in majoring in cs would have fallen off  yandziak who began at the university of virginia on saturday is not convinced thats the case he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class with a 39 gradepoint average and nailed the highest possible score on his advancedplacement exam in computer science  all of my classes have been easy for me math and sciences were always fun so i looked for professions in which i could use those things yandziak said im just not sure i want my life to be immersed in technology i want to do something that will contribute to the practical world  harris n miller president of the information technology association of america said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage  there was a tremendous imbalance in the late 90s potentially you have the same sort of thing going on right now people are saying i dont need this kind of it training right now  miller said our concern as an industry is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment down the road four years as the economy picks up once again companies are going to find themselves in a shortage situation  economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices but other factors including program difficulty personal interests and social influences also come into play said judy hingle director of professional development at the american college counseling association the perception of computer science as an isolating nerdy profession is one that many in the industry have tried to squelch that stereotype went underground during the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust  all the hipness is gone yandziak said once we thought of the internet as this thing with infinite capabilities it was basically just a fad that came along  lamont thompson a recent graduate of calvin coolidge senior high school in the district is headed to morehouse college in atlanta to study business marketing with the intention of going into real estate development  technology comes natural to people my age its not fascinating anymore thompson said to be honest with you when i think computer science i think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room its a necessity but i wouldnt take it any further   ,ham,ham

the novelist currently on trial in paris for calling islam the stupidest religion  httpcanewsyahoocom0209175ozxahtml   tuesday september 17 1107 am est   french writer tried as antiislam protest erupts  by caroline brothers   paris reuters  provocative french novelist michel houellebecq  faced a paris court on tuesday for allegedly inciting racial hatred  by calling islam the stupidest religion and its holy book the  koran a depressing read   the case brought against him by four muslim groups is a cause  celebre reminiscent of the salman rushdie affair pitting freedom of  expression against religious sensitivities   the muslim groups which include the meccabased world islamic  league and the paris mosque accuse the writer of insulting islam in  an interview with the literary magazine lire during last years  launch of his novel plateforme   lire is also on trial over the remarks which have taken on an added  significance in france in the atmosphere of heightened sensitivity  and concern about islam following the september 11 attacks by muslim  radicals in the united states   shortly after the trial started 11 people in the courtroom stripped  off their shirts to reveal tshirts saying no to the censure of the  imams and marianne veiled marianne raped  a reference to the  female symbol of the french republic   freedom of expression freedom of expression they and other  houellebecq supporters chanted after they were thrown out of the  courtroom at the main law courts in central paris   while intellectuals argued before the trial that houellebecq should  be free to write what he wants lyon mosque rector kamel kabtan  retorted we are for freedom of expression but not for insulting  communities   bete noire   houellebecq 45 the bete noire of contemporary french literature  is no stranger to controversy he offended conservatives and the  politically correct left with his 1998 novel les particules  elementaires atomised in english   paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur says muslims have been insulted  once before by houellebecq who had the main character in plateforme  admit he felt a quiver of glee every time a palestinian  terrorist was killed   the world islamic league the lyon mosque and the national  federation of muslims in france have joined the paris mosque in  bringing houellebecq to trial   frances human rights league joined them as a civil party saying  houellebecqs comments amounted to islamophobia and deserved to be  sanctioned as part of the leagues struggle against discrimination  and racism   the paris mosque has hired jeanmarc varaut one of frances leading  trial lawyers whose past clients include maurice papon the former  official condemned in 1998 for naziera crimes against humanity for  sending jews to death camps   restoring blasphemy   houellebecqs lawyer emmanuel pierrat argues that the case  effectively reestablishes the notion of blasphemy despite the fact  that france as a secular state has no such law and says  houellebecqs opponents want to deny him freedom of expression   he also argues that the interview in lire truncated a sixhour  conversation and houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the  article before it appeared   houellebecqs publisher flammarion has distanced itself from the  author whose comments some say may have cost him frances  prestigious goncourt prize  for which he had been a contender   the novelist who lives outside cork ireland writes in a detached  style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to  love   translated into 25 languages

situation in california by issuing an order  pursuant to section  202  c  of the federal power act  to require generators and marketers to make  power available to meet the state  s electricity needs  the emergency  directive requires that  if the california independent system operator  iso   certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity  certain  suppliers would be required to make power available to the iso if they have  power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm  customers  those suppliers that have provided power to the california power  exchange  px  and the iso over the last 30 days that have firm capacity  available would be subject to the order   under the order  the iso is required to provide notice to each supplier  subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by 9  00 pm  est on the day before the requested service  the iso must  to the extent  feasible  allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each  supplier  s available power  the price for the power provided pursuant to the  order will be set by an agreement between the iso and the supplier  if no  agreement is reached  ferc is to determine the just and reasonable rate at a  later date  the order will remain in effect until 3  00 am est on december  21  2000 unless modified      epa sets plans to regulate plants  mercury emissions     epa administrator carol browner  in a long  awaited announcement  indicated  last week that the administration will require reductions of mercury  emissions from coal  and oil  fired power plants  the agency stated that it  plans to propose new regulations in december 2003  and hopes to finalize new  rules by december 2004   in the wake of the decision  eei called on epa to make certain that any  program to control utilities  mercury emissions be based on the best  scientific information available in order to assure the protection of public  health   eei urges epa to maintain its commitment to resolving the key  scientific and technological issues   said paul bailey  eei vice president   environmental affairs  given these uncertainties  eei is disappointed that  the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health  threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science   said mr  bailey    in the meantime  the electric power industry will continue to work with all  stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions  from power plants may be needed  and how those cuts should be achieved   mr   bailey concluded

satalk ot dns mx record clarification please this may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a better response to this elsewhere  i have setup two mx records mail and bmail for my mail server the one i gave a 10 bmail the other a 20 mail  bmail10 i gave a 10 because i want all mail to go through this server to be scanned for spam and viruses and then relayed to the mail20 server for delivery  as i understand it dns a records are used in a rotating fashion for load balancing but dns mx records are used in order or prority meaning the 10 before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isnt available  but only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10 never goes down why have i got something confused here  thanks v  end of forwarded message        this message has been scanned for viruses and dangerous content by mailscanner at compwizcom and is believed to be clean     this sfnet email is sponsored bythinkgeek welcome to geek heaven httpthinkgeekcomsf  spamassassintalk mailing list spamassassintalklistssourceforgenet httpslistssourceforgenetlistslistinfospamassassintalk   ,ham,ham

subject data for moody  s riskcalc  craig and kim   as you know  i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody  s riskcalc   you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc   well  after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through today  s 2  hour moody  s presentation  it is necessary for us to have information about enron  s counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc   we have obtained some information on enron  s european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office   we need for you and  or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enron  s north american counterparties   more specifically  to evaluate moody  s riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enron  s north american  private firm  counterparties   fiscal year  the prior twelve months of financial data are represented  annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables  such as cost of goods sold  net income  sales  and ebit  the value should be a four  digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000  forecasts until the year 2009 can be made  a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year  s  1999  inflation level  in general this  estimation error  will not cause any great problems  as size affects default rates at very large scales  e  g    10  000  000 vs   1  000  000 makes a significant difference   1  000  000 vs   1  050  00 does not    cash  equivalents  this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities   inventory  inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet  in thousands dollars  without any alterations for accounting method  e  g   lifo  fifo  average cost   this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue  specifically this would include purchase cost  sales cost  sales taxes  transportation costs  insurance costs  and storage costs   current assets  this item primarily represents cash  inventories  accounts receivables  marketable securities  and other current assets   total assets  total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars  for example   15  500  000 should be entered as 15500  specifically  total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property  plant  and equipment plus other noncurrent assets  including intangible assets  deferred items  and investments and advances   leave previous year  s total assets blank for australian companies   current liabilities  liabilities are positive values  included in current liabilities are short  term debt  accounts payable  and other current liabilities   total liabilities  this balance sheet account  total liabilities  is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long  term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities  including deferred taxes  investment tax credit  and minority interest    retained earnings  retained earnings  a historical measure of performance  is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders  typically  it is the prior year  s retained earnings plus net income less distributions  retained earnings are generally positive  some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings  leave this field blank for australian companies   sales  this item consists of the industry segment  s gross sales  the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period  reduced by cash discounts  trade discounts  and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers   cost of goods sold  entered in thousands of dollars  this value is generally a positive number less than sales  it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production  such as material  labor  and overhead  not fixed overhead

depreciation  it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income   interest expense  this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short  and long  term debt  typically  we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities  one measure of computing this is  interest expense  0  07  total liabilities   net income  this item represents the income  or loss  reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations  a loss is represented by a negative sign  for example  a  5  000  000 loss would be entered as  5000  leave previous year  s net income blank for australian companies   extraordinary items  positive or negative  this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement  the items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations  these items include extraordinary gains  losses  income  loss  from discontinued operations  and cumulative affect of accounting changes  expenses are entered as negative values  gains as positive values  leave previous year  s extraordinary items blank for australian companies   country  this model is calibrated for the united states  canada  and australia   we look forward to receiving this information for enron  s private firm north american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the

last time you spent 25 did u make 100000s well this time you will wjuhello  you may have seen this business before and ignored it i know i did  many times however please take a few moments to read this letter i was amazed when the profit potential of this business finally sunk in and it works  with easytouse email tools and optin email success in this business is now fast easy and well within the capabilities of ordinary people who know little about internet marketing and the earnings potential is truly staggering  ill make you a promise read this email to the end  follow what it says to the letter  and you will not worry whether a recession is coming or not who is president or whether you keep your current job or not yes i know what you are thinking i never responded to one of these before either one day though something just said you throw away 2500 going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife what the heck believe me no matter where you believe those feelings come from i thank every day that i had that feeling   i cannot imagine where i would be or what i would be doing had i not read on its true every word of it it is legal i checked simply because you are buying and selling something of value  as seen on national tv  making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home  thanks to the computer age and the internet  be an internet millionaire like others within a year  before you say bull please read the following this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately due to the popularity of this letter on the internet a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below to see if it really can make people money the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal  their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 25 out of pocket cost  due to the recent increase of popularity  respect this program has attained it is currently working better than ever  this is what one had to say thanks to this profitable opportunity i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required to my astonishment i received a total 61047000 in 21 weeks with money still coming in  pam hedland fort lee new jersey  another said this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it but one day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my 25 on it i followed the simple instructions and walaa  3 weeks later the money started to come in first month i only made 24000 but the next 2 months after that i made a total of 29000000 so far in the past 8 months by reentering the program i have made over 71000000 and i am playing it again the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything  more testimonials later but first    print this now for your future reference    if you would like to make at least 500000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably please read the followingthen read it again and again    follow the simple instruction below and  your financial dreams will come true guaranteed  instructions  order all 5 reports shown on the list below   for each report send 5 cash the name  number of the report you are ordering and your email address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report make sure your return address is on  your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems  when you place your order make sure  you order each of the 5 reports  you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them your total cost 5 x 5  2500  within a few days you will receive via email each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1000s of people who will order them from you also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer  important  do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report or their sequence on the list in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits once you understand the way this works you will also see how it will not work if you change it   remember this method has been tested and if you alter it it will not work people have tried to put their friendsrelatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money but it does not work this way believe us some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed because if you do it will not work for you remember honesty reaps the reward   this is a legitimate business you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time  1 after you have ordered all 5 reports take this advertisement and remove the name  address of the person in report  5 this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune  2 move the name  address in report  4 down to report  5  3 move the name  address in report  3 down to report  4  4 move the name  address in report  2 down to report  3  5 move the name  address in report  1 down to report  2  6 insert your name  address in the report  1 position  please make sure you copy every name  address accurately this is critical to your success    take this entire letter with the modified list of names and save it on your computer do not make any other changes  save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data to assist you with marketing your business on the internet the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk emails legally where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going  method  1 by sending bulk email legally   lets say that you decide to start small just to see how it goes and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5000 emails each lets also assume that the mailing receives only a 02 210 of 1 response the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 02 also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only 5000 each  continuing with this example you send out only 5000 emails with a 02 response that is only 10 orders for report  1 those 10 people responded by sending out 5000 emails each for a total of 50000 out of those 50000 emails only 02 responded with orders thats 100 people who responded and ordered report  2  those 100 people mail out 5000 emails each for a total of 500000 emails the 02 response to that is 1000 orders for report  3  those 1000 people send 5000 emails each for a total of 5 million emails sent out the 02 response is 10000 orders for report  4  those 10000 people send out 5000 emails each for a total of 50000000 50 million emails the 02 response to that is 100000 orders for report  5  thats 100000 orders times 5 each  50000000 half a million dollars  your total income in this example is 1 50  2 500  35000  4 50000  5 500000  grand total55555000  numbers do not lie get a pencil  paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it you will still make a lot of money   remember friend this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5000 you mailed to dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100000 emails each or more  there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting with thousands more coming online every day believe me many people will do just that and more  method  2 by placing free ads on the internet   advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response we strongly suggest you start with method  1 and add method  2 as you go along for every 5 you receive all you must do is email them the report they ordered thats it always provide same day service on all orders  this will guarantee that the email they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report  available reports  the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you  order each report by its number  name only notes always send 5 cash us currency for each report checks not accepted make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number  the name of the report you are ordering your email address and your name and postal address  place your order for these reports now     report  1 the insiders guide to advertising for free on the net  order report  1 from

historically families have usually had more children than parents resulting in family trees that looked like pyramids however in recent years especially in countries like britain and the us the number of children per generation has steadily gone down while life span has increased this has led to a shape of family tree that some researchers have likened to a beanpole  tall and thin with few people in each generation the term beanpole family has been around in the academic literature at least since 1987 but it rarely appears elsewhere a recent british report has brought it to wider public notice at least in the uk some researchers find it too slangy and prefer the jargon term verticalised to describe such families whatever term you prefer specialists are sure that the demographic shift is having a big effect on personal relationships within the family and for example the role of grandparents  the rising divorce rate partly explains the growth of the beanpole family with almost one in two marriages ending in divorce many adults have at least two families each with a single child                                              observer may 2002  noting the rising number of socalled beanpole families in britain families with only one child the report warns that a child without siblings is starved of the companionship of family members of their own age  leading to greater social isolation with teenagers adopting a more selfish attitude to life                                             guardian june 2002   2 weird words jobbernowl  a stupid person a blockhead  unfortunately this useful and effective insult has rather dropped out of use in these mealymouthed times the last excursion for it that i can find is in the classic w c fields film the bank dick of 1940 in which the word occurs in a variant form in the line surely dont be a luddieduddie dont be a mooncalf dont be a jabbernow youre not those are you before that it turns up in one of the novels of hall caine in 1890 but even by then it seems to have been rather rare  its from the old french jobard from jobe silly that word was then added to noll the top or crown of the head the noddle the first sense was of a blocklike or stupidlooking head but was soon extended to refer to the quality of the mind within jobbernowlism is the condition or state of being a jobbernowl or an act or remark that is especially stupid  careful how you use it the recipient might be a subscriber   3 beyond words  ive been away at a heritage conference in colchester these past few days on my way back my eye was caught by this warning sign posted above some steps at the local railway station     caution    do not run on the stairs    use the hand rail   4 qa  q for my job i have to read american magazines concerning consumer electronics home systems burglar alarms etc i very often come across the expression bells and whistles which seem to relate to equipment accessories or features that are offered to the customer as plusses but are not really indispensable for the device to work is that right and where does that funny phrase come from herve castelain france  q youre right about the meaning of this phrase which refers to gimmicks  nonessential but often engaging features added to a piece of technical equipment or a computer program to make it seem more superficially attractive without enhancing its main function  the phrase is actually quite modern and may be a product of the american military at least one of its earliest appearances was in an article in atlantic in october 1982 which said it was pentagon slang for extravagant frills theres some evidence that the term has actually been around since the 1960s but the early evidence is sparse  where it comes from is still a matter of learned debate a literal sense of the phrase appeared around the middle of the nineteenth century referring to streetcars railways and steamships before modern electronics there were really only two ways to make a loud warning noise  you either rang a bell or tooted a whistle steam made the latter a real power in the land anybody who has heard the noisy outoftune calliope on the steamboat natchez at new orleans will agree about its power though less so about its glory and at one time clang clang clang went the trolley in large numbers of american cities  at least some early us railroad locomotives had both bells and whistles as this extract from an article in appletons journal of 1876 shows    you look up at an angle of sixty degrees and see sweeping   along the edge of a precipice twothirds up the rocky   height a train of redandyellow railwaycars drawn by   two woodburning engines the sound of whose bells and   whistles seems like the small diversions of very little   children so diminished are they by the distance  could it be that to have both bells and whistles was thought excessive a case of belt and braces an unnecessary feature a frill  possibly but its more probable the slang sense of the term comes from that close musical relative of the calliope the theatre organ extraordinary instruments such as the mighty wurlitzer augmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to help the organist accompany silent films among them car horns sirens and bird whistles these effects were called toys and organs often had toy counters with 20 or more noisemakers on them including various bells and whistles in the 1950s decades after the talkies came in but while theatre organs were still common in big movie houses these fun features must have been considered no longer essential to the function of the organ but mere fripperies inessential addons  its possible the slang sense grew out of that it got taken up especially by the computing industry perhaps because opportunities to add them are so great                            q the designation of robes for academic dress clearly comes from its origin with the clergy in the middle ages but what about mortarboards the best i could find was its origin in the 12th or 13th century clergy cap but that was not squareshaped does mortarboard refer to the guilds or is its origin more ancient  a the academic cap often called a mortarboard is quite ancient but that word for it only dates from the middle of the nineteenth century a less slangy way to identify it is to call it a square the literal mortar board is the wooden plate usually with a handle underneath on which bricklayers carry small amounts of mortar a similar tool is used by plasterers but they usually call it a hawk  what seems to have happened is that the similarity in shape between the brickies board and the academic cap led some wag probably at oxford university to apply the name of the one to the other our first recorded use is in a book of 18536 the adventures of mr verdant green an oxford freshman by a clergyman named edward bradley who wrote under the pen name of cuthbert bede the names of the two patron saints of durham where he went to school verdant green is a sort of undergraduate pickwick and the book recounts his adventures this magisterial reprimand by a don appears after one such escapade i will overlook your offence in assuming that portion of the academical attire to which you gave the offensive epithet of mortarboard more especially as you acted at the suggestion and bidding of those who ought to have known better  after a slow start the book became a huge success selling more than 200000 copies in the next 20 years whether mr bradley invented the slang term we may never know but his book certainly popularised it                            q i got into a discussion about chip off the old block with friends and we are wondering if it had to do with sculpting jewelry making woodworking or none of the above what does this term mean and where did it come from vijay renganathan  a the associations are with carpentry and the block is definitely made of wood  the first form of the expression was chip of the same block meaning that a person or thing was made of the same stuff as somebody or something else so from the same source or parentage an early example is in a sermon by dr robert sanderson at one time bishop of lincoln dated 1637 am not i a child of the same adam  a chip of the same block with him  later that century another form is recorded a chip of the old block which meant that somebody was the spitting image of his father or continued some family characteristic at some point probably late in the nineteenth century this was modified to a chip off the old block which does nothing to change the sense but is the way its now usually written or said   5 endnote  the sum of human wisdom is not contained in any one language and no single language is

datapower announces xmlinsiliconno analysis yet dont know what to make of it yet but heres the raw  bits for all to peruse and check out whats really going on best  rohit    datapower delivers xml acceleration device byβ scott tyler shafer august 27 2002 546 am pt  datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed  specifically to process xml data unlike competing solutions that  process xml data in software datapowers device processes the data in  hardware  a technology achievement that provides greater performance  according to company officials  the new device dubbed datapower xa35 xml accelerator is the first in a  family of products expected from the cambridge massbased startup the  datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology  called xg3 that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml  data  according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xa35 accelerator was  conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future  proliferation of web services and as a means to share data between two  businesses  our vision is to build out an xmlaware infrastructure kelly said  the xa35 is the first of a family  kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up  to 20 times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on  application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best  alternative  in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount  importance in the world of xml  todays firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly  said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall  firewalls are blind to xml today  future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on  security especially as web services proliferate kelly said  according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml  processing are homegrown and done in software  an approach the company  itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed  and security after trying the software path the company turned to  creating a solution that would process xml in hardware  our xg3 execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly  adding that to his knowledge no other companys solution does kelly  said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with  technologies that claim to do xml processing  claims that he believes  will be mostly false other contentaware switches such as ssl secure socket layer  accelerators and load balancers look at the first 64 bytes of a packet  while the xa35 provides deeper packet inspection looking at 1400 bytes  and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained  the 1uhigh network device has been tested against a large collection of  xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language  as they pass through the device  the xa35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load  balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify  and process those packets that are xml kelly said  in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application  coprocessor this deployment method gives administrators more granular  control over what data is inspected and the application server itself  controls the device  datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market startup  sarvega based in burr ridge ill introduced the sarvega xpe switch in  may and earlier this month tarari an intel spinoff launched with a  focus on content processing and acceleration the datapower device is now available priced starting at 54995 the  company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in  field trails at a number of other enterprises    datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was  founded in early 1999 by eugene kuznetsov a technology visionary who  foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols  would have on enterprise networks long before industry interest in xml  grew kuznetsov assembled a team of worldclass mit engineers and  designed the industrys first solutions to address the unique  requirements for processing xml the first such solution was a software  interpreter called dgxt this softwarebased approach to xml processing  is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today  leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from  developing softwarebased accelerators kuznetsovs team raised the bar  and designed a system for processing xml in purposebuilt hardware in  2001 datapowers effort produced xml generation three xg3β„ά the  industrys fastest technology for xml processing bar none  today xg3β„ά technology powers the industrys first wirespeed xml  network devices enabling secure highspeed applications and xml web  services while other companies are just now marketing first versions of  products datapower is delivering its third generation of technology  providing an immediate return on technology investments to  industryleading customers and partners  datapowers mit heritage is complemented by a management team that  brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries  drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including  akamai argon cascade castle networks sycamore and wellfleet    datapower technology secures 95 million in funding  venrock associates mobius venture capital and seed capital back pioneer  in xmlaware networking for web services  cambridge mass  july 8 2002  datapower technology inc the  leading provider of xmlaware network infrastructure today announced  that it has secured 95 million in series b financing investors for  this round include venrock associates mobius venture capital and seed  capital partners michael tyrrell of venrock bill burnham of mobius  and jeff fagnan of seed capital have joined datapowerβ€™s board of  directors  datapower will use this funding to accelerate development marketing and  sales of the companyβ€™s breakthrough technology for xmlaware networking  founded in 1999 datapower invented the worldβ€™s first intelligent xml  networkingβ devices capable of transforming xml traffic and transactions  at the wirespeed enterprises need to effectively embrace web services  and other xmlcentric initiatives datapowerβ€™s solutions are based on  its patentpending xml generation three xg3β„ά technology  enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate interand  intracompany communications but their network infrastructure is ill  prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type  datapowerβ€™s xmlacceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of  xml that is required to support next generation enterprise  applications said eugene kuznetsov cto and founder of datapower  technology  datapower gives companies the ability to use xml thatβ€™s critical to web  services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance a single  datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10  serversβ€”breaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml  processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment in  addition the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security  protection against xmlbased denialofservice attacks connection of  ebusiness protocols for incompatible xml data streams load balancing  between backend servers and realtime statistics reports  in the postbubble economy technology investment decisions require  laserfocused scrutiny datapowerβ€™s patentpending technology addresses  a very real and growing pain point for enterprises said michael  tyrrell of venrock associates by turbocharging their networks with  datapowerβ€™s unique xmlaware networking technology companies will be  free to adopt next generation web services without encountering  performance and security pitfalls  we looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly  growing problems surrounding xml message processing performance and  security said bill burnham of mobius venture capital datapower is on  their third generation of technology their patent pending xml  generation three xg3β technology was quite simply the single most  compelling technology solution we have seen to date  xml is not a nicetohave it is a must have for enterprises serious  about optimizing application efficiency since 1999 datapower has been  developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of xml and web  services said jeff fagnan of seed capital partners datapowerβ€™s  xmlacceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely  on xml for mission critical applications  about

debianstyle taskpackages for rh80 availablehi  this has been hashed over a few times on various lists now i finally got  around to doing something about it you can now add rpm httpkotiwelhocompmatilai redhat80 task to your sourceslist  and after aptget update you can find out whats available with  aptcache search task  these are generated directly from compsxml of rh80 so they contain  exactly the same packages as youll get by choosing the various categories  at install time i didnt bother including srpms for these as they are  rather uninteresting if you want you can regenerate the specs by  running httpkotiwelhocompmatilaicomps2taskcomps2taskpy  btw the repository only contains the taskpackages youll need an  aptenabled mirror of rh80 in your sourceslist to actually do anything  with it    	 panu        rpmlist mailing list  httplistsfreshrpmsnetmailmanlistinforpmlist   ,ham,ham

an heroic sermon about the glory to be won in battle by  young  patriots armed with the love of god he usurps the pulpit and prays the  following    o lord our god help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with our  shells help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their  patriot dead help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of  their wounded writhing in pain help us to lay waste their humble homes  with  a hurricane of fire help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending  widows  with unavailing grief help us to turn them out roofless with their little  children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags  and  hunger and thirst sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of  winter broken in spirit worn with travail imploring thee for the refuge  of  the grave and denied it  for our sakes who adore thee lord blast their  hopes blight their lives protract their bitter pilgrimage make heavy  their  steps water their way with their tears stain the white snow with the  blood  of their wounded feet we ask it in the spirit of love of him who is the  source of love and who is the everfaithful refuge and friend of all that  are sore beset and seek his aid with humble and contrite hearts amen    twain wrote the story the war prayer in 1905 during the american  occupation of the philippines but the

entire article could be  rewritten to explain rss in fact lets do that   if it were april fools day the nets only official holiday and you wanted to  design a 8220novelty format8221 to slip by the w3c as a joke it might  look something like rss 09x20    it would specify limits on data values then remove them then specify  required elements then make them optional thus silently breaking an unknown  number of parsers around the world   it would encourage use of entityencoded html in its most important element  thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user   it would ignore years of standards work in other fields committing such  egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasnt a guid and using an  obsolete date format that couldnt easily be sorted by date   its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core  namespace without telling anyone or documenting them thus making it wholely  resistant to dtd schema or validation of any kind   after years of worldwide deployment it would completely reverse its  addwhateveryouwant extensibility rules in favor of namespaces which the  spec would neither define nor elaborate on   after adopting namespaces it would fail to deprecate any existing elements  semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use it would also  fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the  same thing in two different ways thus ensuring mass confusion among producers  and inconsistent behavior across consumers   rss 09x and 20 are the whoopee cushion and joy buzzer of syndication formats  for anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata its  pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication  format we have the worst one possible   except of course for all the others   the problem with that list of rss deficiencies is that it is also a list of  necessities8212rss has flourished in a way that no other syndication format  has not despite many of these qualities but because of them the very  weaknesses that make rss so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it  possible in the first place    removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened  up rss to a whole new category of producer the weblogger   allowing encoded html in description let publishers reuse both their existing  content and the existing rss infrastructure without requiring them to produce  valid xhtml which could be embedded directly into an xml document social  mores rather than technical rules prevent producers from intentionally  introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable  display through unclosed html elements   few publishing tools can produce real conforming guids and it doesnt  matter because virtually all rss parsers are written in high level languages  where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes  and handling bytecodes as for dates by convention an rss document is laid out  in reverse chronological order and no one seems to be clamoring for more  flexibility   furthermore its almost babyish xml syntax so far from any serious  computational framework where are the namespaces where is the document type  description why is the aggregators enforcement of conformity so lax made  it possible for anyone wanting an rss feed to write one the effects of this  ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts  over the years to 8220do rss right82218212most notably rss 10 in the  year 2000 rss 10 had three main benefits    backward compatible with rss 090 which was never widely deployed and which  fell into obscurity as soon as the much simpler rss 091 was introduced   based on rdf specifically a serialization called rdfxml a spec which at  the time and to this day continues to change or threaten to change two years  later there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with  parsers to consume rdf although many perl python net have thirdparty rdf  parsers in various states of development and conformance the release version  is generally out of date cvs access is recommended you get the idea  meanwhile rdfxml production tools are so inconsistent that even rdf experts  recommend not using rdf tools to produce an rss 10 feed if you want it to  actually be read by any major rss aggregator despite the twoyearold promise  of better tools2 it is now the year 2002 and i built my rss 10  feed8212in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the  world8212by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets  into a textarea of an html form   extensible through namespaces which as mentioned above have been  haphazardly and poorly incorporated into rss 20 where they appear to be  flourishing   evolvable formats8212those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a  thousand small ways8212have three main characteristics that are germane to  their eventual victories over strong centrally designed formats    only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed  my rss feed is an xml document produced by a template that i built in a  textarea and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know  nothing of xml and hack apart my feed with regular expressions the world is  littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools  if everyone in the world had a perfect rdf parser at their disposal it would  be trivial to produce and consume all the worlds metadata in rdf without such  perfect tools both production and consumption instantly become nightmares  there is no middle ground   what is is wrong because evolvable formats have always been adapted to  earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions  they are always behind the times rss was being stretched with long  descriptions optional titles and entityencoded html even before such  practices were codified in the spec and long before all consumers could handle  them no evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it  faces   finally orgels rule named for the evolutionary biologist leslie  orgel82128220evolution is cleverer than you are8221 as with the list  of rsss obvious deficiencies above it is easy to point out what is wrong with  any evolvable system at any point in its life no one seeing rss 10 and rss  091 sidebyside could doubt that rss 10 had the superior technology that it  8220did things right8221 however the ability to understand what is  missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central  group can design a better system in the long haul   designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically evolvable  formats start out weak and improve exponentially rss 20 is not the perfect  syndication format just the best one thats also

tcpa and palladium content control for the masses tcpa and palladium content control for the masses  while security experts poke and jab at what bits and pieces of the tcpa and palladium specs they can get ahold of they have tended to focus on how they work and what they imply as far as concerns such as privacy and security go or alternatively in terms of how they would impact the functionality of the general purpose logic device  analysts both favorable and unfavorable have been analyzing them from these standpoints while paying much less attention to what the proposals imply from the standpoint of what content control itself really means  the most significant problem with tcpa and palladium is not whether they may interfere with the power of the universal logic device or whether they are effectual from the standpoint of privacy and security concerns though these are all very important concerns  rather the fundamental problem they present is in the political premises that they hope to implement for the sake of the content industries  tcpa and palladium are the technological realization of the concepts embodied in the wipo performances and phonograms treaty wppt which only came into effect this past may 20th with little public notice or fanfare of course  the wppt declares an unprecedented moral right of authors to control public uses of their works  thats the real game plan  tcpa and palladium are simply content control for the masses  they constitute an effort to democratize content control under the concept of moral rights encouraging the public to overlook the clear public interest issues raised by the specter of content control and to confuse these issues with private interest issues such as privacy and security  they are an effort to get the public to jump on the bandwagon without adequate consideration of whats really on the line  in america we have never supported the concept of moral rights which the wppt professes  the us constitution accords congress the power to grant or deny exclusive rights to works and inventions for the purpose of promoting the progress of the useful arts and sciences not for the purpose of rewarding the originality of creators  though that result is obviously a consequence of exclusive rights statutes such as copyright law  our supreme court explicitly articulates this distinction and for very good reason  in america we implicitly understand the distinction between expression the aspect of works to which copyright statute applies and the facts and ideas that make up a work to which it does not apply  the reason for this is essential and unavoidable and must be stated clearly and unequivocally at this juncture information is free  its not that it wants to be  it is and it always has been  this fact is unassailable however unless we let come to pass a world that subscribes to universal content control for the sake of socalled moral rights implemented at the behest of narrow content industry interests  tcpa and palladium are initiatives that hope to encourage the general public and more specifically producers of information products in general to identify content control with moral rights blithely overlooking the real implications of information technology in a free society and the long tradition of american jurisprudence upholding the freedom intrinsic to information a freedom on which the prospects of information technology crucially depend  seth johnson     cc countercopyright httpcyberlawharvardeducccchtml  i reserve no rights restricting copying modification or distribution of this incidentally recorded communication  original authorship should be attributed reasonably but only so far as such an expectation might hold for usual practice in ordinary social discourse to which one holds no claim of exclusive rights  httpxentcommailmanlistinfofork   ,ham,spam

thought twice about this but what the hey jobs are hard to come by theres a company hiring in mountain view looking for a few good hackers no java no gui not even c  just c and linux and networking and good old stuff like that they just raised a wad of money and theyre looking for a few really good programmers says the cto i know him  very smart guy drives too fast though for what thats worth

original message  from joseph s barrera iii mailtojoebarreraorg  sent tuesday august 27 2002 858 am  to adam l beberg  cc forkexamplecom  subject re java is for kiddies      adam l beberg wrote    forwarding me stuff from a list is hardly handing me a job       i was talking about the open reqs at kana the company i   work for     oh but programming in java is beneath you       nope just lacking years and years of it for some silly   reason people    always want things to be reliable fast and   crossplatform so all my    employers have forced me to code in c     c is more reliable than java    as for crossplatform c exists on more platforms but a java program  is much easier to move from one platform to another so im not sure  what you mean    im not trying to fight a language war but im puzzled by the depth  of your antijava hatred      i know lots of high school    kiddies with plenty of java tho not having to teach people about    pointers or optimization or anything shaves years off the   coder boot    time ill send them your way when they graduate    pointers so a language has to have pointers to be real and   references  dont count i gather whats so great about pointers why do you  miss them if your doing embedded stuff fine yes you need the  performance and control over memory that c provides probably  but if your implementing tier n1 of a tier n system and pounding  against a database then java is often a very reasonable choice  especially if you want that system to run without leaking memory    optimization who says you cant optimize java i can and have  and there are good tools that allow you to do it i use optimizeit  but usually i find myself optimizing reducing database accesses  instead i sped one part of the system up by a factor of ten by  grouping more operations into fewer transactions    but this is beside the point if you have decent c experience and  have poked around in java you should be able to convince most  employers that you can be trusted writing java thats what i did   i mean i joined kana from microsoft and i didnt exactly write  a lot of java code at microsoft      im not displeased youre trying to help just frustrated that    employers can demand such rediculous combinations of skills with    insane years of experience    i dont think ive ever interviewed at a place where i actually  met all the prerequisites do you just give up when you dont      interview tommorow with kodak doing i have no idea what as the    recruiter isnt even sure but cross your fingers it wont require 10    years of java and 5 years of windowsia64s device driver   experience    both common requirements    i wish you best of luck and i apologies for being a bitch  but god damn you piss me off sometimes my son occasionally  displays your cantdo attitude and i do my damnest to  get him to reverse course     joe      ,ham,ham
